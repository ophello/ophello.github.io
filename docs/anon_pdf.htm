<p>Collins claims in 1949, Rand Corporation and the CIA solicited assistance on sample analysis from a Vatican representative; he claims he saw project names <strong>Archangel</strong>, <strong>Blue Book</strong>, <strong>Black Book</strong>, <strong>White Book</strong> and <strong>Yellow Book</strong>, adding that he heard LANL was analyzing green fireballs (this last claim has been confirmed as <strong>Project Twinkle</strong>).</p>
<p>He claims he heard rumors of autopsies of “midget people” at Los Alamos, experiments at Holloman AFB and Kirtland AFB, metal-like wood tested in Berkley he was not involved with, and flying disc landings on military bases in California and New Mexico. Collins also states a friend told him Archangel determined UAP occupants were extraterrestrial, biological, gas-breathing intelligent animals with larger craniums than humans.

George Schulgen states: “It is possible within the present U.S. knowledge—provided extensive detailed development is undertaken—to construct a piloted aircraft which has the general description of the object above
which would be capable of an approximate range of 7,000 miles at subsonic speeds.”
Twining is specifically talking about the “flying disc” phenomena seen by civilians and military personnel that year.</p>

<p><strong>(PUBLIC DOMAIN)</strong> - <strong>24 April 1952</strong> — A special study group within Air Force Intelligence assesses nine undersea UAP with the Office of Naval Intelligence. ONI received the reports from U.S. Navy submarines that encountered the undersea UAPs over an undisclosed timeframe prior to the report. The incidents have never been released by ONI, and FOIA requests into the USAF special study group, AFOIN-X(SG), have been denied.</p>
<p>The group is rumored to have included a Col. Kieling, USAF civil service intelligence specialist Dr. Stefan T. Possony as acting chief, and Lt. Col. F. Sterling as military chief and likely operated outside of <strong>Project Blue Book</strong> as a flexible study group to take on special ad hoc tasks.

Stratton and professor Max Millikan to discuss UAP sightings and a means of studying them through <strong>Project Lincoln</strong>. Lincoln was an already established air defense project at MIT for the USAF, specifically analyzing photographic reconnaissance and surveillance.</p>
<p>The December 1952 memo suggests Lincoln had an interest in flying saucer cases beginning in mid-1952, and CIA OSI sought “full backing” of the DCI for MIT to formally study UAP. Unfortunately, no further Lincoln UAP documentation exists, and Lincoln summary reports do not mention UAP despite Stratton’s interest. USAF Capt. Edward J.

<p><strong>(PUBLIC DOMAIN)</strong> - <strong>12 April 1954</strong> — “KA” states he served in the USAF in 1954-55 at Roswell Air Force Base where he began helicopter training. On the evening of 12 April 1954, KA states he was ordered to report to the flight line as there was a crash in the desert; his crew was “Rescue 4.” The crash retrieval was 25-30 miles northwest over a lake where they saw a metallic saucer crashed edgewise into the sand with a dome in the center, and the outer rim was still spinning and the outer edge lights were still rotating in that direction. Several small bodies were scattered outside the craft, motionless and appeared dead; 4-4.5 feet tall with large heads, in tight fitting dark blue uniforms, no helmets.</p>
<p>KA states a ground crew in fatigues was already there and prevented them from getting closer, and began tagging the objects and the bodies. More dead bodies were inside a small hatchway in the crashed disc. The UAP occupants had tried to crawl out on their hands and knees. After KA returned to Roswell he was debriefed for three days in “living hell” in Building No. 5, and told by men dressed in civilian clothes wearing black ties identifying as “intelligence officers” not to speak about the incident, and reading KA a law that referred to fine, imprisonment with hard labor and general discharge if he told anyone about the incident.</p>
<p>KA states he heard the saucer was taken on base and put in Hangar 18, which was expanded over the next two weeks with refrigeration equipment and sophisticated computers. KA heard a rumor at that time another UAP crashed near Bandelier, NM on 24 April 1954. KA states he was sent back to Sampson AFB where his superior accused him of going AWOL and punished him, to which KA told his superior about the UAP crash and his superior did not believe him. KA had a nervous breakdown and was placed in hospital for three months. During the stay, he was injected with a needle where he felt drunk and taken to a room with 4-5 people where he was asked questions about the crash recovery in New Mexico.</p>
<p>On the day he was released from hospital, KA states he was taken to the base commander’s office and met a Col., who discharged him on 7 March 1955 because he told the Sgt. (superior) about the CR in the desert. KA states that in the years after he was discharged he began having nightmares and needed to talk about the experience, to which Leonard Stringfield listened and believed him.</p>
<p>KA tells Stringfield at the CR, a second chopper landed with four men wearing white pants and long white coats, to which KA tried to photograph them but he was told “don’t take a picture of me, just take what you were told to take.” KA states he saw a silver aluminum colored metallic box on the ground 3 feet long and 1 1/2 feet high with numbers printed on it, there were words too that were indistinguishable; he tried to photograph the box but was told by the ground crew to “get the hell away from that.” The ground crew wore green fatigues with no insignia or rank identity.</p>
<p>KA states later he was told by a stranger in a neighborhood drugstore that he should not talk about his part in the neighborhood drug store and he was called and warned of consequences following a phone call he made in January 1982.</p>

<p><strong>(PUBLIC DOMAIN)</strong> - <strong>1955</strong> — The Air Force issues a statement saying it has a “research and development contract” with the Avro Company of Canada. This is later confirmed to have been Project Silverbug, a variant of the Avrocar, a failed attempt at a flying saucer that was underpowered and unstable when it was tested by Canadian company Avro.</p>
<p>John Frost and Avro Special Projects Group, though, worked on a <strong>Project Y</strong>, <strong>Project 1794</strong> and <strong>Project PV 704</strong> that were said to explore development of flying disc technology that could travel Mach 3 and Mach 4 at 100,000 feet, far faster than other fighters at the time.</p>

<p><strong>(PUBLIC DOMAIN)</strong> - <strong>1955</strong> — Physicist Louis Witten states he was recruited by George S. Trimble, VP for Aviation and Advanced Propulsion Systems at the Glenn L. Martin Company, into the Research Institute for Advanced Studies (RIAS). Witten states Trimble recruited him to develop anti-gravity, and in 2013, stated anti-gravity was “discovered” in this project. Witten suggests several ideas were tested including using an isotope of bismuth, but does not give details. The Glenn L. Martin Company evolved into Martin-Marietta and merged with Lockheed in 1995.</p>
<p>Witten states while at RIAS he got a contract from Areas A and C at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base to work on anti-gravity for aerospace applications. No record of this contract exists but Witten did publish several theoretical articles concerning general relativity while at RIAS, whose legacy program Lockheed eventually acquired. Witten joined the University of Cincinnati after RIAS and was a professor of physics 1968-1991.</p>

The VP states they were asked by Douglas management to assess cases from <strong>Project Blue Book</strong> including films and photos that led them to conclude UAP used “multi-dimensional physics.” The group was asked to forget this conclusion. He claims the Douglas group found a site in the “Owen Valley” where thousands of UAP went in and out of solid ground.</p>

<p>Tompkins claims he was helped by “Nordic” UAP occupants, while the USAF and RAND Corporation were working together with “Reptilian” UAP occupants to create a competing secret space
fleet. Tompkins also claims before the end of WWII, Nazi Germany had aligned itself with “Reptilian” UAP occupants and a secret Navy project out of Naval Air Station San Diego attempted to learn about secret Nazi antigravity programs. Tompkins provides no evidence for these claims, but does provide evidence he worked at Douglas and Naval Air Station San Diego.</p>

<p><strong>(PUBLIC DOMAIN)</strong> - <strong>20 November 1955</strong> — New York Herald Tribune journalist Ansel E. Talbert
writes about an “incredible program” to solve the “secret of gravity” at top U.S. scientific laboratories and research centers. Anti-gravity is reportedly being studied at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton University, the University of Indiana’s School of Advanced Mathematical Studies, the Purdue University Research Foundation, MIT, the Roger Babson Gravity Research Institute of New Boston, NH, and the Institute of Pure Physics (IPP) at the University of North Carolina.</p>
<p>Former UNC President Gordon Gray approved funding for IPP; Gray was formerly Secretary of the Army, Assistant Secretary of Defense and special assistant to the President of the United States (Truman, Eisenhower). Scientists in the project tell Talbert they expect to discover anti-gravity within years to a quarter of a century at most; corporate IPP partners include Glenn L. Martin Co., Convair, Bell Aircraft, the Sikorsky Division of United Aircraft, Lear Inc., Clarke Electronics, the Sperry Gyroscope Division of Sperry-Rand Corp., and General Dynamics Corp.</p>
<p>Among the IPP participants mentioned are: Bryce S. Dewitt of the Radiation Laboratories at University of California at Berkeley, Burkhard Heim of Goettingen University, Pascual Jordan of Hamburg University, Vaclav Hlavaty of the University of Indiana, and Stanley Deser and Richard Arnowitt of the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study.</p>

Case for the UFO (1955), with annotations from three different persons who claim to know about UFO intelligences, deep space origin, underwater bases, force fields, and more. Sherby and Hoover reprint the annotated version with government contractor Varo Manufacturing and prints 25 copies.</p>
<p>ONR’s link to Jessup is curious because in this same year, Jessup claims to have been receiving letters from someone known as “Carlos Miguel Allende,” who claims that an 1943 experiment in the Philadelphia Navy Yard rendered a destroyer (the USS Eldridge or USS Engstrom) invisible and personnel on board showed side effects. The project is soon allegedly linked to the work of Thomas Townsend Brown, who earlier that year proposed a <strong>Project Winterhaven</strong> to the US military to use electrogravitics for aerospace purposes.</p>

<p><strong>(PUBLIC DOMAIN)</strong> - <strong>1 May 1956</strong> — Former USAFHQ spokesman Maj. William T. Coleman claims Air Force Manual section 190-4 was in effect as of this date and after, affecting all USAF press releases, statements to Congress and the public, and publications about UFOs. Coleman later tells NICAP that AFM 190-4 requires the Secretary of the Air Force Office of Information to delete all evidence of UFO intelligence control, which contradicts the official stance at the time that true UFOs didn’t exist. He
admits that Maj. Lawrence J. Tacker’s book was reviewed under the regulation, something the Air Force previously denied. Coleman states even if Tacker wished to provide UAP evidence, it would have been prohibited.</p>

<p><strong>(PUBLIC DOMAIN)</strong> - <strong>Late 1956</strong> — The General Physics Laboratory of the Aeronautical Research Laboratories/Aerospace Research Laboratories (ARL) at Wright-Patterson AFB hires physicist Joshua N. Goldberg to administer multiple contracts related to relativistic theories of gravitation. Goldberg works here until 1963, before joining the University of Cincinnati for a year and moving on to other universities. Curiously, fellow anti-gravity researcher Louis Witten joined the University of Cincinnati after his contracted work for Wright-Patterson ended in 1968 (see 1955).</p>
<p>Goldberg states in his CV he worked for the Armour Research Foundation in Chicago, IL for four years before being recruited to ARL, working on applied research for industry and government. It is
unclear if Goldberg or ARL worked on UAP-related research but the many possible linkages in the PUBLIC DOMAIN are interesting. Hubert Goenner of Goettingen, a former participant of RIAS (see 1955), writes ARL may have also studied Soviet efforts in anti-gravity.</p>

<p><strong>(PUBLIC DOMAIN)</strong> - <strong>1958</strong> — The US Air Force commissions a special studies group within Air Force Intelligence headed by Stefan Possony to analyze a book written by Nazi Maj. Rudolf Lusar, commanding officer of German Army technical unit in WWII. Lusar claims Nazi scientists were working on jet engines and thermal imaging a decade before the West. Lusar also claims German scientists were working on direct energy weapons and sound weapons, and also “flying saucers.”</p>
<p>Lusar claims Germany began developing saucer technology in 1941 with scientists Schriever, Habermohl, Miethe and Italian engineer Bellonzo/Belluzzo. Lusar claims German saucer technology were developed in Breslau, Poland and Prague, Czechoslovakia and once achieved an altitude of 12,400m and a speed of 2000 km/hr.</p>

</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Note</em></strong>: Author Nick Cook evaluated the claims in Lusar’s book and finds mixed corroboration, particularly the existence of Schriever and Belluzzo. Schreiver worked for Heinkel Aircraft Company, the developer of the world’s first jet-powered fighter, the He 280; Belluzo was an industry minster in Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini’s cabinet and once wrote of
disc-shaped “flying bomb” technology passed on to Germany.</p>
<p>Schriever also made comments to West German media in 1950 that a flying machine he worked on at a Heinkel facility at Marienehe would have changed the course of the war.</p>
<p>Lusar claimed Miethe was taken to Wright-Patterson AFB in the US, while Habermohl was allegedly captured by USSR and moved to a Soviet design bureau east of Moscow, but Cook found no corroboration of this.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Note</em></strong>: Cook did however find the existence of a US Army Air Forces files on the German Air Force’s secret weapons program at the Air Force Historical Research Agency at Maxwell Air Force Base, and another copy at the Office of Air Force History at Bolling Air Force Base.</p>
<p>US Office of Technical Services (OTS) was given responsibility of hauling German documentation out of the country post WWII, and one responsive document was found, a memo from Lt. Col. A.R. Sullivan Jr., which stated “balls of fire” and foo fighters (early terms for
UAP) had no connection with information found by OTS in Germany, in documents, interrogations or facility visits.</p>
<p>Raw OTS reports discovered by Cook, though, show a facility in Brunswick was working on radio-controlled craft and discovered by US officials; another facility in Vienna experimented with direct energy weapons; another in Stuttgart used EM to interfere with vehicle motors.</p>
<p>Cook suggests Sullivan’s report may have been falsified to cover-up to shut down further investigation of technology linked to foo fighter/UAP development.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Note</em></strong>: Italian author Renato Vesco, citing Italian sources after WWII, claims saucer technology was developed differently than Lusar claims. Vesco states a craft called the “Feuerball” developed in Oberammergau in Bavaria (OBF) could interfere with Allied craft with intense EM fields. The Kugelblitz was allegedly larger and built in an underground weapons complex in Thuringia aka the Harz. The crafts were shaped like the shell of a tortoise and radio-controlled.</p>
<p>Vesco claims he obtained this information from British Intelligence Objectives Subcommittee (BIOS) and US-UK administered Combined Intelligence Objectives Subcommittee (CIOS); others who have access to BIOS/CIOS say no evidence of the Kugelblitz or Feuerball exist in the records.</p>

McCormack states the Air Force “has not been giving out all the information it has on UFOs.” A year earlier McCormack, the Senate Preparedness Committee and the House Science and Astronautics Committee were briefed by USAF and told no government agency or department was withholding information on the subject. McCormack’s comments in 1961 suggests he believed he was lied to.</p>

<p><strong>(PUBLIC DOMAIN)</strong> - <strong>17 March 1961</strong> — USAF ATIC is asked by the House Armed Services Subcommittee how the USAF can improve UAP sightings. ATIC states the best solution is to give its primary advisor J. Allen Hynek a raise of $1,000 per year and purchase one new polaroid camera and one new geiger counter for field work. It also recommends raising the count of commissioned officers working on UAP from 1 to 2.</p>

<p><strong>(PUBLIC DOMAIN)</strong> - <strong>13 November 1961</strong> — USAF document “AFCIN-1E-0 Draft Policy” written by Lt. Col. Norman M. Rosner to Col. Betz writes that intelligence team personnel are needed to support Air Force <strong>Projects Moon Dust</strong>, <strong>Blue Fly and “UFO,”</strong> and other quick reaction projects. The document gives the 1127th Field Activities Group at Ft. Belvoir responsibility for UAP “collection
responsibilities,” and importantly, divorces these responsibilities from Moon Dust and Blue Fly, described as projects to locate, retrieve and deliver foreign space vehicles.</p>
<p>The document also distinguishes crashed UAP from Soviet/Bloc vehicles, and describes the need for quick reaction recovery teams. For decades after, the USAF continued to rely on the conclusions of Special Report No. 14 to debunk UAP, which stated no compelling physical evidence had ever been recovered from UAP, despite debris collection teams existing.</p>

<p><strong>(PUBLIC DOMAIN)</strong> - <strong>1962</strong> — USNR test pilot “PJ” states he saw a saucer at WPAFB in 1962 while attached to the 354th TAC Fighter Wing deployed to WPAFB on a hurricane evacuation from Myrtle Beach AFB. He and five men walked through the base looking for a gym and entered the Special Services Hangar and burst through the doors only to see an air police sentry with a sub-machine gun guarding a 12-15 foot by 8 foot object saucer with no rivets, roped off, guarded by eight guards. The guard told them “I don’t think you’re supposed to be here, Sir,” to which they left and believed the US developed flying saucers.</p>
<p>When he returned to Myrtle Beach AFB he was debriefed by his Brig. Gen. and was told he broke security, asked if he saw anything (to which he replied nothing), to which the Brig. Gen. Said “You have the right answer to the question.” PJ had a TS clearance that allowed him to fully research gaining valuable insight otherwise impossible. PJ was puzzled by the lack of security and wasn’t in a test facility, suggesting that it was near the flight line because it had just arrived or was awaiting deployment.</p>

When he landed there were tents and a pre-fab hangar and at the site were men in fatigues without insignia. RT was assigned guard duty. RT states he looked inside the hangar and saw a metallic disc with a dome on top with no windows, around the craft were men at work and tables with technical instruments. A large walk-in refrigerator unit on skids had several empty body bags.</p>
<p>RT states he was seen looking into the tent, escorted to the officer in command Col. “P”, USAF Medical Corps, reminded of his Security Oath and confined to his quarters before being sent back to Pendleton for punishment. RT states when he called APRO about the CR he began receiving threats, he was visited by an intelligence agent and reminded of his Security Oath, his apartment was pillaged on 21 July 1980, visited on 22 July 1980 and threatened where RT performed a citizen’s arrest with a gun and the police booked the man before another man in a “limousine” showed the police their credentials and he was released.</p>

<p>This method is the same Thomas Townsend Brown proposed in the 1950s (see 1952), what Franklin Mead (see June 1972) at Edwards AFB pursued for decades, what Hal Puthoff (see 2002) suggested a black budget program utilizes, and what Mark McCandlish testified (see 9 May 2001) was used to develop USG recreations of UAP craft.</p>

RK states he heard it was shot down by a missile between Hawaii and the mainland in June 1973, and was picked up on a destroyer’s radar and made three close passes. RK states he heard the object was retrieved by a Glomar Explorer, shipped to Hawaii, and then sent Stateside and to Chicago.</p>

<p><strong>(PUBLIC DOMAIN)</strong> - <strong>October 1973</strong> — Sgt. Michael D. Jenkins, 96th Security Police Squadron at Dyess AFB, TX worked security over nuclear-armed B-52 bombers. The base had a nuclear weapons storage area as well. Jenkins states he and his squadron were ordered to draw arms from the armory and patrol after a large spherical UAP was seen over the weapons storage area. Jenkins states he heard an order to “move it out of the area,” afterward hearing gunfire and seeing a “streak of bluish-white light moving at high speed” out of the base. “It was the UFO getting out of there,” he states. Jenkins and others were told not to speak about the incident under penalty of court-martial.</p>
<p>Jenkins states the next day he saw a Top Secret teletype that chemical analysis had been done on a thin, strand-like physical substance recovered outside on the base property. Neither Congress nor the American people at the time were aware that physical evidence was being recovered after UAP events.</p>

<p><strong>(PUBLIC DOMAIN)</strong> - <strong>11 October 1973</strong> — Civilians Charles Hickson and Calvin Parker claim they see an oval UAP and are taken aboard the craft by “robots” for examination near the Pascagoula River in
Mississippi. Hickson refused to take a polygraph, but former <strong>Project Blue Book</strong> advisor J. Allen Hynek stated the testimony was sincere.</p>
<p>Parker claims his father once worked for the Atomic Energy Commission near Area 51, and the sighting occurred near a shipyard managed by Ingalls Shipbuilding, then owned by Litton Industries, creator of advanced space suits for the USAF and NASA. The appearance of the alleged entities Hickson and Parker saw may match the description of advanced experimental suits Litton was designing at the time. Was this event a military test of some kind using “UAP abduction” as a cover?</p>

<p><strong>(PUBLIC DOMAIN)</strong> - <strong>March 1974</strong> — A large self-illuminated object hovers above the Romeo-29 launch facility at the Malmstrom AFB Romeo Flight missile alert facility near Brady, MT. A missile launch officer with the 564th Strategic Missile Squadron reports a nuclear missile countdown is started, and the officer flips the “inhibit” switch to turn the system offline. The system then restarts spontaneously and the missile again goes into launch mode; the officer’s next “inhibit” order doesn’t work. Fortunately, the launch code is false and the missile remains in its pad.</p>
<p>The UAP then moves away from Romeo-29 vertically at high speed. An F-106 attempts to intercept but is unsuccessful and Malmstrom AFB radar tracks the UAP. Electronics in Romeo-29 are fried from an electric surge. This event occurred at a time when the USAF was referring Congress and the American public to the findings of <strong>Project Blue Book</strong>, which concluded UAP were not a national security threat. The Romeo-29 event very clearly was a threat to national security and nuclear war.</p>

Told him a UAP crashed in the Southwest in 1957, four bodies were recovered and badly burned but their silver spacesuits were not damaged and fused to the flesh, and sent to WPAFB for deep freeze; the heads were larger than the bodies but facial features were erased by the heat; a CR team got into the craft through a fissure in the shell; it was transported by rail using cover as “classified rockets” to WPAFB.</p>
<p>M.S. claims Gen. T showed him a TS document about a UAP landing at Nellis AFB in 1968 reading “Large UFO hovered over Nellis AFB for three days. Three small alien craft were observed separating (or being ejected) from the parent craft. One landed on the Air Base grounds. Sent to greet the landed craft was a Colonel with security detachment properly armed. There was no mention of an attempt to assault the craft. While waiting for a sign of intent, a humanoid was observed to disembark from the UFO craft, which was described as ‘short and stocky.’ Then a beam of light was directed at the Colonel. The Colonel was instantly paralyzed, according to the report. Orders then came from the officer next in command for his troops of the security detachment to fire, but their weapons were mysteriously jammed. The Colonel was recovered and hospitalized.”</p>

<p><strong>(PUBLIC DOMAIN)</strong> - <strong>November 1977</strong> — USAF Security Alert Team member Mario A. Woods Jr., stationed at Ellsworth AFB, SD, states he flashed a spotlight at a possible UAP to attempt to communicate and it responded. Hours later, Woods and his team partner responded to an penetration alarm on the outer zone of the site, witnessed the UAP at a distance and again directly over the site. It was a red-orange sphere “constantly swirling and churning.”</p>
<p>Woods next states they looked at the object, he felt like he couldn’t breath and looked at his colleague who had a blank stare on his face; he too could not breath. Woods flashed a flashlight at the object and the pressure went away. He next states he sees “something like shadows” outside the vehicle and hears voices in his head “Do not fear” repeatedly. He next sees five or six “small figures” walking toward the vehicle before passing out.</p>
<p>Woods regains consciousness at dawn, after four hours have passed, and he, his team partner and their truck are near Newell Lake, miles from the site. They are found and recovered by Ellsworth personnel and debriefed by AFOSI. Woods was ordered to take a urinalysis and skin samples. Woods states he has two small puncture marks on his skin under his left armpit and above his ankle, and he often has “strange dreams of that night…every time, as something was about to happen or show itself, a great dread came over me. I would awake in a pool of sweat and afraid.” It is unclear if Congress has been made aware of possible abductions of USG personnel and certain the American people have not been made aware of this possibility.</p>

<p><strong>(PUBLIC DOMAIN)</strong> - <strong>18 January 1978</strong> — Alleged USAF Incident/Complaint Form shows a UAP sighting incident and body recovery at Ft. Dix and McGuire AFB. The form states it was distributed to Col. Landon and Brig. Gen. Brown at AFOSI. It states a UAP sighting occurred over Ft. Dix and an “unidentified being had been shot by Dix MPs.” “Some kind of body found” and the area was cordoned off, and recovery teams notified.</p>
<p>Retired USAF Maj. George Filer III claims he was there, the recovery team acted like it had seen that type of incident before, and states he was denied access and never cleared to see photos. He claims he heard that the being was gray/brown with a fat head, long arms and slender body.</p>

<p><strong>(PUBLIC DOMAIN)</strong> - <strong>19 September 1978</strong> — NASA Associate Administrator for Space Sciences Noel Hinners testifies to the House Committee on Science and Technology with respect to “extraterrestrial intelligence research.” Hinners makes extensive references to the search for ETI using telescopes and the possibility of life somewhere else in the Universe.</p>
<p>Hinners decides not to mention, though, that NASA elected eight months earlier to study physical evidence retrieved from UAP on Earth if presented with it. In fact, it was Hinners himself responsible for a letter sent to Southeast Missouri State University in Cape Girardeau, MO that stated NASA would receive “bona fide physical [UAP] evidence.” One year later, a letter to Hinners from a colleague writes the UAP physical evidence program is ongoing, known as “UFOHEAP,” though it seems to be unfunded.</p>

<p><strong>(PUBLIC DOMAIN)</strong> - <strong>8 December 1978</strong> — The United Nations votes 33/426 to establish an agency or department of the UN to study UAP, failing to pass the draft resolution. Former <strong>Project Blue Book</strong> consultants J. Allen Hynek and Jacques Vallée speak to the UN Special Political Committee, which is not interested in the formal study of UAP. Public records on these meetings show no sitting element of the DOD or U.S. intelligence community spoke in support of the resolution, despite the fact that the Air Force, Navy and NORAD are all on record having monitored UAP events over the prior decade.</p>

BDM also hosted the “Advance Theoretical Physics Conference” to study UAP under DOE supervision, see entry 20 May 1985 for more details. It is a natural question as to whether or not Sen.

<p><strong>(PUBLIC DOMAIN)</strong> - <strong>May 1979</strong> — Former special assistant to the Deputy Director of the CIA, Victor Marchetti, writes that “we have, indeed, been contacted — perhaps even visited — by extraterrestrial beings, and the U.S. government, in collusion with other national powers of the Earth, is determined to keep this information from the general public. He states the CIA does not discuss UAP openly because they are “sensitive activities,” and claims the NSA may have picked up signals intelligence related to crashed UAP. Marchetti states it is a cover-up.</p>
<p>Marchetti also states he heard rumors at high levels of the CIA of “little grey men whose ships had crashed, or had been shot down, being kept on ice by the Air Force Foreign Technology Division at Wright-Patterson AFB.”</p>

<p><strong>(PUBLIC DOMAIN)</strong> - <strong>27 June 1979</strong> — Anonymous informant claims in a forested area in southeastern Oregon near the Idaho border, near a hunter campsite, a UAP crash allegedly occurred on this date. The informant was charged with loading crates onto helicopters and by the time he arrived at the crash retrieval, the object had been removed from the deep ruts it created in the Earth and placed on a
semi-trailer covered by a tarp, it looked disc like with a dome; pieces of strange metal had fallen behind the trailer onto the ground dull grayish-brown in color.</p>
<p>After he cleaned up the site and it was evacuated, he was soon “abruptly” transferred to embassy duty in Central America for several months; the informant also states he viewed UAP “artifacts” and bodies at Grafford AFB in Nevada on Thanksgiving weekend in 1973 or 1974 before being abruptly transferred to Guantanamo Base in Cuba for several months.</p>

<p><strong>(PUBLIC DOMAIN)</strong> - <strong>17 November 1980</strong> — AFOSI counterintelligence officer Richard C. Doty delivers a forged document to physicist and Coast Guard veteran Paul F. Bennewitz. Doty states he was ordered by his superiors to confuse Bennewitz, who had observed an NSA laser project at Kirtland AFB from his own property near the base. Doty convinced Bennewitz what he saw was of paranormal origin, UFOs, and Bennewitz developed delusional paranoia and was committed to a psychiatric hospital as a result of AFOSI’s actions. Sen. Peter Domenici met with AFOSI; existing documentation suggests AFOSI may have also misled Domenici because it did not inform him of the disinformation targeted at Bennewitz.</p>

<p><strong>(PUBLIC DOMAIN)</strong> - <strong>14 December 1980</strong> — “Larry W.” writes Leonard Stringfield and claims that while at Arizona State University in 1975, a classmate of his “Mr. DR,” told him he witnessed a UAP “capture or retrieval” in 1968 while in the Army attending intelligence school in a remote desert area of Texas, approximately 50 miles from Big Spring, TX.</p>
<p>One mile from the Army compound was a small 16 acre USAF “facility” too small to be considered a full fledged base; it was restricted, well guarded and patrolled; Larry claims it had a large
metal building and warehouse, 1-2 small guard houses and a nearby concrete helicopter landing pad, with no airstrip or runway, surrounded by an 8 foot chain link fence topped with barbed wire.</p>
<p>He claimed he and other classmates observed unusual activity at the USAF site, which was only entered or existed by blue, officially marked USAF vehicles; large flat-bed trucks entered the warehouse but none to his knowledge ever left; he stated he believed a large underground workshop was set up beneath the warehouse; within months, he received written orders not to observe, talk about or go near the USAF facility; 5-6 of his classmates decided to find out what was going on and tried to enter the facility wearing USAF fatigues, they were not heard from for a month and all but one returned to the school with apparent psychological effects.</p>
<p>Two to three months later after this breach, all Army personnel were restricted to their quarters and windows were blacked out; a small group went to a crawl space in the attic above their bunks and removed some of the roof’s shingles to look out, seeing an “intense twinkling light descending in rapid, jerking movements,” that was changing colors, diminish in intensity and take a shape, before dropping to the ground; “it was in no way a conventional craft,” it was relayed to him; the object was disc shaped with a small bulge on top, the air shimmered around the craft as if it were hot, and no occupants were seen; USAF personnel surrounded the object when it landed; the next morning the area was clear.</p>
<p>DR states in 1971 he was warned by a Col. not to mention anything about UAP and Big Springs
Base.</p>

<p><strong>(PUBLIC DOMAIN)</strong> - <strong>July 1980</strong> — Sunn Classic Pictures releases the film Hangar 18 about a cover-up following a crashed UAP in Arizona; the craft in the story is taken to the fictional “Wolf AFB” in Texas where it is analyzed. The occupants are described as near-human and match a similar story told to Linda Moulton Howe by AFOSI counterintelligence agent Richard Doty at Kirtland AFB three years later.</p>
<p>Sunn Classic Pictures was established in 1971 by the Schick Razor Company, of which Patrick J Frawley was a co-founder with significant creative input.</p>
<p>Frawley was a knight of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta (SMOM), a Roman Catholic order with ties to the CIA and former CIA directors who served as knights including William Casey and John McCone. Frawley was also connected to the American Security Council as a member and donor, a military lobbying organization with membership of James Angleton, Nathan Twining and Douglas MacArthur, among others. Of note, Col. Philip Corso, who claimed UAP programs quietly encouraged film production for disclosure purposes, was a Shickshinny Knight of Malta, a breakaway group from SMOM.</p>
<p>Sunn also produced In Search of Noah’s Ark in 1976 at a time when the CIA was investigating Mt. Ararat as a location of the Ark (and mention Ararat in the film), The Amazing World of Psychic Phenomena about psi and TK during the predecessor programs of <strong>Project Star Gate</strong> and The Outer Space Connection, a film about the ancient alien hypothesis.</p>

<p><strong><em>Note</em></strong>: In the open source, quantum teleportation was first proposed in 1993 and achieved in 1997. Most recently, researchers have teleported information between atoms dozens of kilometers apart and have transferred information between clouds of gas atoms. A recent study at University of California also suggested human brains were ready for teleportation due to a unique natural behavior of the hippocampus. Still, Basiago’s claims are astounding and suggest teleportation technology in the black is hundreds of years ahead of open source, if true, though they may very well be false claims.</p>

<p>Sarbacher states his work with RDB was limited but he heard “certain materials reported to have come from flying saucer crashes were extremely light and tough,” and were likely analyzed by US laboratories very carefully.

<p>His other claims: Germany may have recovered a saucer as early as 1939; Gen. James Doolittle went to Sweden to inspect a saucer that crashed in Spitsbergen in 1946; in 1947, Truman established MJ-12; in the late 40s there was more saucer crashes in Roswell, Aztec and Laredo, TX; one saucer that
crashed in the 1950s was so large that logistical problems prevented it from being transported and it was buried; the logistics stories are “legendary” and include moving only at night, purchasing whole farms, cutting down forests, blocking major highways, driving 2-3 trucks in tandem, etc.</p>
<p>He also claims on 30 April 1964, the first communication between aliens and the USG took place at Holloman AFB; they made a “deal” in exchange for technology the USG would ignore abductions and the EBEs told them abductions were merely monitoring; in fact, abductions were the insertion of implants, implementation of posthypnotic suggestion, termination of some people so they could be biological material, termination of people who are a threat, genetic experiments and impregnation; he claims in 1979 there was an altercation at the Dulce laboratory; by the 1980s, MJ-12 was concerned the mistake they made dealing with the EBEs and began to promote positive film projects like Close Encounters and ET; some of MJ-12 meeting at the “Country Club” wanted to confess the scheme, the other majority chose to develop anti-UAP weapons under cover of SDI.</p>

According to SAIC investigator Dennis Cravens, assistant director of Los Alamos National Laboratory’s Center for Explosive Technology Research Pharis Williams was essential to the research.</p>
<p>SAIC, citing Williams, suggests a five-dimensional theory of thermodynamics could lead to a unified field theory and novel propulsion methods. The report also mentioned antigravity was not achieved using a rotating cylinder filled with mercury, but that the research should be reconsidered in the future.</p>

<p><strong><em>Note</em></strong>: Pharis Williams has several indirect ties to UAP research. Los Alamos colleague Oke Shannon told a journalist in 2019 “if we were to build an anti-gravitational device, it would be built on the principles involved in [Williams’] theory.” Shannon attended the 1985 “Advanced Theoretical Physics Conference” under DOE supervision led by USAF Col. John Alexander to determine if UAP evidence supported an R&amp;D program. The meetings were held at BDM Intl’s McLean Secure Facility and classified using DOE controls (see second note under 28 April 2006). Shannon’s name was also mentioned on the alleged meeting notes between Dr. Eric Davis and VADM Thomas R. Wilson where a secret UAP program was discussed (see 16 October 2002).</p>
<p>Pharis Williams also spoke at a UAP technology conference in June 2001 where it was mentioned his research was sponsored at the time by Hal Puthoff. Williams was still employed at Los Alamos at the time; Puthoff became involved in <strong>AATIP</strong> eight years later.</p>

<p><strong>(PUBLIC DOMAIN)</strong> - <strong>June 1989</strong> — USAF Capt. Richard P. Osedacz writes an unclassified paper at the Air Force Institute of Technology at Wright-Patterson AFB stating a database of UAP in near-Earth orbit exists and has existed since at least 1972. UAP events tracked by NORAD are termed “fastwalkers.” Osedacz writes NORAD tasked the USAF Foreign Technology Division, Flight Performance Division (FTD/SQDF) to analyze unknown datatracks.</p>
<p>The paper adds that “undocumented” simulations were performed on UAP in the Space Surveillance Center within NORAD Cheyenne Mountain Complex. It is unknown if conclusions on fastwalkers have been delivered to Congress in a classified setting, but they have not been detailed in open hearings, nor have they been delivered to the American public.</p>

<p>On that same date, a commodities broker claims he saw helicopters transporting a large object and three other witnesses claim they saw jeeps and military vehicles with a police escort going to Brookhaven National Laboratories that morning. An anonymous scientist “Dr. Nick” at Brookhaven told LIUFON a large object was recovered and transported there, adding it weighed very little; he claims it was wedge or boomerang shaped, he had previously worked at “S-3” beneath WPAFB to study UAP; and the technology was crystalline-based; he states the weapon was developed by AIL Electronics and it was tested at Fort Meade, MD five months prior. He stated he had been threatened not to talk about this.</p>
<p>“Joseph Z.” wrote Leonard Stringfield and claimed he had access to classified government records; per three Pentagon computer systems the next day, Z claims no weapons were deployed, NAVSYCOM had been tracking a polar-orbiting satellite with a decaying orbit and considered a radiation hazard; Office of Foreign Technology requested US Coast Guard helicopters to provide illumination from

<p><strong>(PUBLIC DOMAIN)</strong> - <strong>1990</strong> — A ret. physicist who claims to have worked closely with Oppenheimer, Einstein and Teller states in 1990 that he worked on a special project at Edwards AFB in the late 1960s/early 1970s on <strong>Project Blue Heaven</strong>. The source states a flying saucer and its crew landed at Edwards AFB and its occupants were carted off to a secure building for evaluation. The disc was kept in a big hangar with armed guards with possibly hundreds of people working on it.</p>
<p>The source states the occupants had eyes of one color, a nose, a mouth, and teeth that looks like they were made there. They were dressed in a silvery looking material with elements not of Earth, and their blood looked like oil. The bodies were light brown, and the researchers came to the conclusion because there were no deterioration, to leave them alone because another craft might come and rejuvenate/reactivate them. The craft had no seams, no rivets, no welding with a dome at the top.</p>
<p>The other scientists told him it was made of a material they “never dreamed could exist,” and they had not figured out how to cut a hole in it. The ret. scientist states the project is still active at the time of disclosure (1990), and it was run by the DOD, while the Navy had 2-3 similar research projects. He also states Nixon had awareness, and some bodies were at Homestead AFB, corroborating Jackie Gleason’s claims of seeing bodies at Homestead. His security went from the President through the Director of the CIA to him.</p>
<p>The scientist referred to a special group of scientists that worked with the President called the “Special Committee.” He states he changed some parts of his story re: the craft in 1991 and alluded he had to protect that information as he was in contact with an office in Washington D.C. that had been established over the last 6 months to make a decision on “how to keep everyone from finding out what is really going on.”</p>

The Government can’t spend appropriated money on projects that Congress doesn’t know about; it’s an even greater offense if they spend private money to do it…whatever the secret project, it must be controlled by an incredible level of fear because nobody dares talk about it. I find no leaks anywhere.”</p>

Thomas says it had no water dripping off it, made no sound and it
shortly after flew up vertically out of sight. Thomas says he was interviewed by people in civilian clothes why he was outside and what he saw; Thomas said he didn’t tell them he saw the triangle because he was concerned he would be disciplined.</p>

<p><strong><em>Note</em></strong>: This concept is repeated by the remote viewing group the Farsight Institute, who calls it a “Death Trap.” Former SRI contractor (who itself was a contractor for the Army) Robert Monroe states something similar, that interdimensional beings harvest humanity for their energy and force them to repeat their lives on Earth. Former UK politician Simon Parkes states “reptilians” are in control of a soul recycling system. Buddhism teaches reincarnation is an endless cycle of suffering only broken by enlightenment, while ancient Greek Gnosticism teaches humans are divine souls trapped in the physical world where escape can only be achieved by not worshiping the false god (Demiurge), but rather, gaining secret esoteric knowledge about who humans really are, where they are from, how parasitical entities work and how how to be free of a soul trap ran by entities they refer to as “Archons.”</p>

USAF Col. tells ufologist Tim Cooper early UAP were thought to be German, used nuclear power in a way not understood and were composed of metals and plastics not known on Earth. The USAF panicked when it recovered flying discs in the Mojave Desert and New Mexico, he claimed, and transported them to Muroc AFB and Langley; they were lifting bodies that looked like inverted bathtubs that looked like a “pod” or short-range recon probe. Von Braun, Condon, Oppenheimer and Teller worked on scientific research of the crash retrievals he claimed.</p>
<p>The Col. had “no comment” on “who” helped them and suggests it was ET, but doesn’t explain. He states there were other USAF projects besides <strong>Blue Book</strong> that were UAP related including <strong>Project Black Book</strong> or <strong>Project Black Sky</strong> that used advanced cameras and sensors on high altitude aircraft like the X-2, X-15 and U-2, plus cameras on rockets that were launched from White Sands and the Cape to look for UAP. He also claims he heard of a USAF Project White Book that looked into historical UAP sightings including some from the Vatican back to the 15th century; allegedly the Vatican has UAP sighting photos going back to 1915 of all shapes and sizes rumored to be locked in a vault room inside the Vatican Basilica and even the USAF could not get access.</p>

The scientists claim the work has engaged in satanic ritual and human sacrifices, and that although some efforts to use NHI are for “good,” they’re convinced what is being tapped into is “evil.”</p>
<p>The scientists claim the research of David Bohm has been expanded upon; that everything exists everywhere at once enfolded into an invisible timeless medium. They show the journalist photos of individuals killed during psychotronic weapons experiments, that some UAP sightings are the projections of physical 3D objects by undisclosed projects, etc.</p>
<p>The scientists claim NHI can work unseen to humans; create incisions and perform medical procedures that are undetected; create the illusion of being extraterrestrial beings, phantom helicopters, etc.; that the ET scenario is disinformation to protect NHI projects; the NHI established contact in psi/mind control weapons development programs; NHI are spiritual beings that can control human minds, monitor them and possess individuals; that NHI seek to deceive human minds to prevent belief in their conqueror (suggested by scientists to be of Christian origin, “Jesus Christ”).</p>

<p>Riconosciuto claims this knowledge was gained from working at Lear in Reno, NV and from working with Gerald Bull of Space Research Corporation. Sources close to Riconosciuto also claimed other IC sources that were unsubstantiated stated there was a “war” in the intelligence community between a group centered in the CIA called Aquarius (around a powerful center known as MJ-12) and a group known as COM-12 centered around Naval Intelligence.

D’Amato at the time was counsel to the Senate Appropriations Committee under Sen. Robert C. Byrd. D’Amato tells Vallee that he looked into triangular UAP like those seen in Belgium from 1989-1990. D’Amato believed the craft were human and the project that makes them was illegal. “No money was ever appropriated for it.

<p><strong><em>Note</em></strong>: Former SSCI Staff Director Christopher K. Mellon stated in 2021 he also looked into USG/USG contractor black aerospace programs for Sen. Byrd, in addition to the triangle UAP wave in Belgium for the SSCI. Mellon states on the record that “there is no such [secret U.S. triangular craft] program, we don’t have anything like that…it was definitely not, it was not something we had on the books.”</p>
<p>This conflicts with D’Amato’s comments, who assisted Sen. Byrd into his investigation into USG/USG contractor black aerospace programs, with D’Amato telling Vallee the triangular UAP were an illegal human program.</p>
<p>Mellon stated on the U.S. cable-broadcasted Episode 2, Season 2 of the History Channel’s Unidentified: Inside America’s UFO Investigation that “I don’t believe these are ours” with respect to triangular UAP, something the episode concluded. The episode was co-produced by To The Stars Academy of Arts and Science, of which Mellon was an advisor.</p>

John Ford, an investigator of this incident, stated he was worried for his safety; he told Michaels the UAP was shot down by a plasma beam using quark gluon technology via R&amp;D being done at Brookhaven; he also claims DOE had done anti-UAP directed energy weapons testing in the past using technology at Brookhaven and Los Alamos. Of note, Mona Rowe, an employee at Brookhaven at the time, said she saw a UAP near the facility at the time of the alleged crash retrieval.</p>

<p><strong>(PUBLIC DOMAIN)</strong> - <strong>22 December 1992</strong> — British embassy in Washington D.C. writes to assistant chief of Air Staff in London re: USG reaction to triangular UAP sightings. Specifically, three years earlier, British Royal Observer Corps (ROC) member Chris Gibson witnessed a triangular UAP refueling from a KC-135 Stratotanker alongside two F-111s. The sighting became public in 1992, after which, British officials monitored USG reaction: “Secretary of the Air Force, Donald B Rice, was to say the least incensed by the renewed speculation…that he had lied to Congress by stating that Aurora did not exist.” [Aurora was a rumored name for a USG/USG contractor triangle craft reverse engineered from UAP technology.] British intelligence writes the situation caused “considerable irritation” within USAF.</p>

<p><strong>(PUBLIC DOMAIN)</strong> - <strong>1994</strong> — Former New Mexico State Rep. J. Andrew Kissner states sources within White Sands Proving Ground and Naval Research Lab told him flying discs led to USG personnel deaths in 1947, that 2-4 flying discs were recovered that year, and the craft were processed and analyzed by the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC)’s Los Alamos National Laboratory and its Z Division at Sandia Base. Personnel from the JRDB, MIT, Brookhaven National Laboratory, RAND Corporation, NACA and the Rockefeller Institute also played “major roles” following the 1947 crashes, Kissner stated. He adds that Project Supremacy could have been UAP related, specifically the triangulated radar sites set up in New Mexico in late 1947; he states the 4062nd AISS group was at all three sites and responsible for UAP data collection per AFR 200-2.</p>
<p>Kissner added his sources told him the custody of the flying discs was given to the AEC and its national laboratories by classified Presidential Executive Order in July 1948, with the National Security Council (NSC) serving as overall program coordinator with support from Air Force Systems Command, the Naval Research Laboratory, and the Research and Development Board. Kissner unfortunately did not reveal his sources, which were never vetted. In 1974, the AEC was reorganized into the Energy Research and Development Administration and in 1977, the ERDA was reorganized as part of the Department of Energy (DOE). One year after Kissner’s allegations, the DOE told the GAO it could find no records from 1947 related to UAP crashes.</p>

Forrestal established the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project (AFSWP), an agency to manage nuclear weapons jointly staffed by the Army and Navy. AFSP and Los Alamos National Laboratory’s Z Division established operations at Sandia Base at that time in New Mexico. It is worth determining if these facilities were ever utilized for UAP research as well, like Kissner suggests, and if elements of UAP research are controlled by AFSP/AEC/ERDA/DOE legacy classification mechanisms.</p>

<p><strong>(PUBLIC DOMAIN)</strong> - <strong>28 July 1995</strong> — Rep. Steven Schiff comments on the release of a General Accounting Office (GAO) report detailing an audit related to an alleged UAP crash in 1947 near Roswell, NM. Schiff states important documents from Roswell Army Air Field (RAAF) were “destroyed without proper authority.” Schiff says these raw messages would have shown how military officials in Roswell were explaining to their superiors what happened. Without them, a cover up could have been initiated by higher level officials. The records “should have never been destroyed,” Schiff added, stating the GAO told him the messages were destroyed in the mid 1950s without following proper protocol.</p>

<p><strong>(PUBLIC DOMAIN)</strong> - <strong>3 August 1997</strong> — National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) historian Gerald K. Haines publishes what claims to be an extensive report on the CIA’s role in the study of UAP between 1947-1990. Haines says <strong>Project Blue Book</strong> purposefully covered up NRO overflights of U-2 and SR-71, deeming them unidentifieds or natural phenomena, but provides no evidence. <strong>Blue Book</strong> head Robert J. Friend states the story is “laughable,” implying that Haines’ report was created to purposefully wash away
the national security concerns of true UAP. Nonetheless, the news media picks up the NRO report and the concept that there is nothing to UAP circulates, and is promoted by CIA and NRO web properties.</p>

<ul class="list">
<li>  (I) Mechanical using high speed rotation based on the work of Laithwaite, Wallace, Kidd, McCabe, Stratchen, Delroy, Foster, Dean, Forward, dePalma, Hayasaka and Cowlishaw.</li>
<li>  (II) Acoustical with no moving parts and employ vibration to alter nuclear interactions with gravity based on the work of Keely, Leedskelstein and Tibetan stone levitation.</li>
<li>  (III) Rotating disc/cone using stationary electrodes at high voltage based on the work of T.T. Brown/Bielfeld and Bahnson, Naudin, Hartman, Nipher, Pages, Kelly, Rieken, Searl, Hammel, Davidson, Saxl, Halik, Shauberger, Carr, Hooper, Huaro, Smith and Vril/Shumann.</li>
<li>  (IV) AC/RF or microwave EM devices based on the work of Alzofon, Tesla, Littlejohn, Sweet, Nielsen, Seike, Hutchingson, Farrow, Bielik, Zinser, Peshka, Schlecker and Smith.</li>
<li>  (V) Solid state devices using antigravitic/shielding based on the work of Podleketnov and Schnurer.</li>
<li>  (VI) Nuclear antigravitation that allegedly causes a breakdown of Newton’s third law based on the alleged work of Bearden, Wallace, Dan Fry, GIlbert Jordan, the claims of Robert Lazar (element 115) and Charles Brush. It is alleged that cold fusion with zero-point energy interaction can achieve this effect.</li>

<p><strong>(PUBLIC DOMAIN)</strong> - <strong>1998</strong> — USAF Master Sgt. Edgar A. Fouche states he temporarily worked at the Defense Advanced Research Center (DARC) in 1979, which he claims is a facility beneath Groom Lake with at least 10 underground stories. Fouche states he was recruited to DARC while he was working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) at Edwards Air Force Base, which also had underground facilities.</p>
<p>He states a full antigravity propulsion system was developed, there is a secret space fleet using this technology, and he overheard conversations that suggested quasicrystals were an enabling technology for propulsion and communications.</p>
<p>Fouche also claims triangular craft have been built that are mistaken for UAP, contracted by Lockheed, Boeing, Northrup, Teledyne Ryan and managed by the NRO, NSA and CIA. Fouche claims the triangular “TR-3B” provides logistics and transportation support for the secret space program and they house a minimum of four crew members, the top 1% of elite pilots from the Navy and USAF. Fouche claims at least three prototypes were built and use “MFD” technology built from reverse engineering UAP at Sandia and Livermore. Fouche claims mercury-based plasma is pressurized, heated and rotated to create a magnetic vortex field which allegedly “disrupts” gravity’s effect on mass by 89%.</p>

<p><strong>(PUBLIC DOMAIN)</strong> - <strong>11 March 1998</strong> — Author Nick Redfern claims a source who was put into contact with him from AFOSI states a group of current and former IC personnel who believed UAP were demonic in origin called the “Collins Elite” published a lengthy document summarizing their beliefs. The report is not published but extracts are; they state the following: “STAC Reports (I to XI) describe the fall, collection, analysis and present whereabouts of unusual fabrics, foils, parchments, chemical residuals and biological material found at found locations in Lincoln County, New Mexico between 3 and 13 July 1947.”</p>
<p>The report mentions the Collins Elite met at the Loftus Boat on 23 May 1997 and that the Collins Elite was unable to convince CIA S&amp;T at “PTC” of viability of sharing with the Collis Elite the “completed NORTH files on NM discoveries of 1947…S&amp;T at PTC are aware of our briefing from STAC on their files but are reluctant to share NORTH material due to security issues that developed from the Nebraska debacle.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Note</em></strong>: The “Nebraska debacle” may refer to the 25 November 1991 entry where two scientists connected with the the DIA and NSA allegedly claim in a face to face meeting in Nebraska that USG/USG contractors are engaged in programs that attempt to control non-human intelligences (NHI) and harness those NHI for military and intelligence purposes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“STAC remain committed to advancement to media and population of both Mogul and extra-terra scenarios for NM fallings and discoveries and are troubled by Collins Elite wishing to advance THE THEORY to media and population. This writer privately engaged STAC Markale in conversation on 17 June 1997 and provided him with an amended copy of New Mexico Origins: Parsons, Hubbard and Babalon Working. Markale remains convinced that if placed into public forum knowledge of THE THEORY will irreversibly and negatively affect global social order.”</p>
<p>“This writer privately explained to Markale that Collins Elite initiatives prepared ot ensure a reasonably acceptable transition of the perceived true nature of the Lincoln County discoveries to public and media, as well as a reasonable long-term acceptance of THE THEORY can still proceed with limited social disorder if handled correctly. Markale is not convinced and speaks for the STAC membership.</p>
<p>Presently STAC-5 is privately sympathetic to the position of Collins Elite; he reiterates the position of CANDLE on 4 May 1991 that STAC is now “in too deep” with its attempts to reverse-control the situation and prevent enemy infiltration and deception beyond present levels.”</p>
<p>“This writer sees that disagreement on our part with STAC is unlikely to inflame situation beyond present levels due to STAC’s genuine sympathy with difficulties created for everyone by recent developments. STAC-5 informs this writer STAC totally rejects notion that Collins Elite’s Learning the Way paper that theorizes radically indoctrinating population with belief and faith — and revelation to media and population of true nature of Lincoln County discoveries — can halt enemy infiltration.”</p>
<p>“This writer remains greatly troubled by STAC decision to continue its relationship with contractors Jamison and Wylie who — according to STAC-5 — are still convinced that the “PARSONS TECHNIQUE” can assist in holding off the deception, infiltration and final invasion. This writer adheres to Collins Elite conclusion based on a reading of the original STAC Reports (I to XI) that any attempt to follow the path of Parsons will only result in a catastrophe of the type warned about in Parsons, von Karman and Goddard: A Door Unlocked.”</p>
<p>“STAC-5 understands this but consistently feels the need to reiterate that situation has gone too far for STAC to back down. STAC-5 also informs that WPAFB sources have had some success using the “PARSONS TECHNIQUE” in achieving spontaneous brief laboratory manifestation of materials very similar to two of those that “fell” at Lincoln County, NM in 1947. STAC-5 is of opinion that if long-term manifestation and stability of materials can be achieved and precise originating point of materials can be determined then this will assist NASA-TZER mission to answer the critical questions posed in our 1991 briefing to STAC, <em>Entry Points — And How Do We Keep Them Closed?</em> ”</p>
<p>“Until final outcome of STAC, NASA-TZER and WPAFB research in this area is known this writer recommends that Collins Elite continues to focus attention on planned disclosure to public of THE THEORY if STAC, NASA-TZER and WPAFB attempts to “close the door” are not satisfactory. This writer concludes that if this hypothetical stage is reached disclosure and intense indoctrination of faith and values at planetary level to radically and rapidly alter current population mindset is the only alternative that may prove successful in thwarting plans of enemy.”</p>
<p>“This writer considers the disclosure to media and population of the Lincoln County fabrics, foils, parchments, chemical residuals and biological material to be crucial and integral in terms of revealing the “Trojan Horse” aspect of THE THEORY. STAC-5 understands this too and agrees that only if present attempts by NASA-TZER and WPAFB-1T to prevent widespread infiltration and enemy deception fail that revelation, explanation of the “Trojan Horse” aspect of the Lincoln County fallings and indoctrination may be only viable alternatives.”</p>
<p>“This writer is encouraged by confident comments from STAC-5 that if present and near-future operations fail to achieve success STAC and Collins Elite would provide a united front that would allow THE THEORY to be presented publicly and quickly and in a way that was acceptable to STAC. For that reason and likelihood that enemy infiltration will not be thwarted by STAC and NASA-TZER methods [deleted] has prepared a unique briefing paper on the Lincoln County Trojans in the event that immediate and emergency dissemination of facts to media and population is required.”</p>

(2) has multiple levels of sub-compartmentalization, (3) exists in the privatized

<p>It is stated this covert entity possesses advanced technologies often mistaken for UAP, including “materialization/dematerialization,” faster than light travel and antigravity propulsion that is a threat to conventional military and constitutional chain of command. One intelligence source tells CSETI the “program” has considered the usage of manmade advanced craft in a “false indications and warnings scenario” in which the manmade UAP attack conventional military assets to make it appear there is an attack by hostile extraterrestrial life forms. The “program” is also allegedly considering the usage of technologies that “hoax” paranormal experiences in the consciousnesses of government/military targets, with adverse psychological effects. CSETI states this has already occurred and alien abduction scenarios are testing by assets of the “program.”</p>

<p><strong>(PUBLIC DOMAIN)</strong> - <strong>7 July 1999</strong> — An alleged CIA source tells ufologist Tim Cooper the UFO control group ceased to exist in government in 1969 and became privately funded and was identified as <strong>Jehovah</strong> in 1992 and at one time was called <strong>Zodiac</strong>. He claims the original MJ-12 was a consolidation of two Pentagon projects <strong>Majestic</strong> and <strong>Jehovah</strong> overseen by a group of twelve institutions within military, intelligence and science; the highest classification as of the letter was termed SACRED, a follow-on to terms TRINE and UMBRA, he claims.</p>
<p>He states Majestic was a government panel appointed by President Truman to look into extraterrestrial contact and ways of detecting non-terrestrial signals, while Jehovah was a DOD project to back engineer recovered UAP hardware and research the physics of how the craft worked. He states J Robert Oppenheimer was appointed by Vannevar Bush to head Jehovah until the AEC took away his clearance in 1954, and by 1960, the group concluded UAP were a threat to US defenses and could instigate mass paranoia if they gained control of US defenses. In 1960 the source claims Eisenhower approved a joint defense plan written by MJ-12 that in the event the US came under a nuclear attack by the USSR through “EBE deception,” the US would not retaliate with the proposed USAF SIOP.</p>
<p>He also states in 1969, President Nixon was briefed by MJ-12 on UAP and all aspects of EBE problem since 1947, after which Nixon approved a SCEO that required intelligence community to purge all references to MJ-12 in their UAP files and to destroy documents that could connect MJ-12 to the JFK assassination. Recently, he claims the dilemma for those “in the know” is that extra-materialized entities (EMEs) have complete control over UAP and can appear anywhere as anything at any time; they have even deceived USG communication projects using remote viewing, he claims.</p>
<p>Other projects mentioned by him are a CIA <strong>Project Environment</strong>, which he claims along with <strong>Project Medea</strong> looked at damage caused by EMEs near nuclear facilities. The prevailing belief of the group is based on materials found in connection with an EME/UAP that a “worldwide invasion” is expected to begin by 2030.</p>

non-profit, holds a board meeting with members including former CIA director R. James Woolsey, former Assistant Secretary of Housing and Urban Development <a href="https://home.solari.com/">Catherine Austin Fitts</a>, and several media and financial industry executives. Meeting minutes show the group “had been approached” by a client to publish a white paper on the subject of life outside of Earth. Fitts later said the Undersecretary of the Navy was the client, who was interested in helping the Navy “adjust their operations for a world in which it was commonly known that aliens exist and live among us.” Fitts claims her time at HUD and after, as a contractor to HUD, exposed her to information that suggested slush funds were connected to FHA and HUD. Fitts believed some of the illegal funding was for domestic “clandestine military R&amp;D,” some of which was UAP related.</p>

Underground, Adair claims he was shown a “symbiotic engine” the size of a school bus whose alloys had an iridescent sheen. Adair states there was no obvious wiring on the engine and his handlers became uncomfortable when he asked where it was from; when he was angry he didn’t get an answer, the engine behaved differently, he claims. Adair suggests the engine may be able to be powered by mental thought but did not know the mechanism.</p>

Plotkin also claims MIT chief science writer Eugene Mallove tells him the Bush Administration’s Energy Resources Advisory Board (ERAB) mislead the executive branch when it relied on a fraudulent MIT report that ignored findings of a successful cold fusion experiment.</p>
<p>The Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI)’s Tom Passell tells Plotkin ERAB lied to Congress and told lawmakers cold fusion had no basis in further study despite knowing otherwise. He suggests DOE is ignoring successful cold fusion experiments such as those by Tom Claytor, and public DOE statements about failure rates are inaccurate according to their own scientists at Los Alamos like Claytor.</p>

<p><strong>(PUBLIC DOMAIN)</strong> - <strong>31 July 1999</strong> — EarthTech and former CIA scientist Hal Puthoff emails former CIA Life Sciences Division analyst Kit Green and his life partner Kristin B Zimmerman about a story published in a UFO magazine by a pseudonym “Greg Halifax” about a UAP crash retrieval personnel member pseudonym “Sedge Masters.”</p>
<p>The story refers to Masters having participated in a UAP crash retrievals group known as “<strong>Zodiac</strong>,” of which Puthoff states “we have reason to believe the set of stories are only slightly fictionalized versions of a source’s experiences writing up records for the archives at WPAFB.” Puthoff asks Green if he’s ever heard of <strong>Zodiac</strong>, “which is supposed to be the true name,” not MJ-12 or Majestic
12. At the time, Green was the Chief Technology Officer of General Motors Asia Pacific, while Zimmerman was with GM Research and Development in the area of advanced design.</p>
<p>The Sedge Masters story itself describes the “blackest of American covert operations” that deals directly with UAP, collated from several different sources, and states a UAP management program exists that falls outside of the normal range of program activities and only members of the intelligence community with specific psychological profiles are selected. It states the program was called <strong>Zodiac</strong>, and had different subdivisions corresponding with different zodiacal signs, including Aquarius. It states the CIA had control over <strong>Zodiac</strong> as of the 1980s and between 1947-1980s, <strong>Zodiac</strong> recovered eleven UAP craft of different sizes and quality, some of which included live occupants of Nordic, small hairy, and tall “grey aliens” and short “grey aliens” appearance. Locations of recoveries listed include New Mexico, off the coast of Denmark and the Midwest.</p>
<p>In the story, an unnamed Col. tells a psychologist that during one crash recovery, a larger UAP “ship” appeared above the crash site and telepathically told the recovery team not to recover the craft. The team then experienced 90 minutes of missing time and were not able to share that information with staff at WPAFB until they were telepathically ‘released’ and able to do so; the psychologist states “the little gray bastards have thought control and empathy projection.” The story also states a file room at WPAFB has over 2 million accounts of UAP sightings by military personnel and US civilians, most of which were never investigated.</p>

There was a US Army marking on the bottom of one helicopter but they were otherwise unmarked; the man proclaimed he had no identification and wasn’t going to provide anything, confidently smiling when the sheriff told him to stop the mutilations. Kit Green reacted to the report while Vallee heard it and suggested it was a USG black operation.</p>

<p><strong>(PUBLIC DOMAIN)</strong> - <strong>April 2001</strong> — In a briefing document presented to some members of Congress and the intelligence community, CSETI’s founders state a covert group controls some elements of the UAP issue using proprietary projects protected by corporate NDA and illegal special access programs (SAPs) protected by USG classification. The briefing states the group is quasi-private/public and operates transnationally, and is centered in industrial “work for others” contract projects related to the application of advanced extraterrestrial technologies. Compartments of the covert group are also involved in disinformation, public deception, UAP tracking and specialized liaison groups (to media, political leaders, scientific community, corporate community, etc). The individuals involved are personnel inside IC SAPs, black units inside corporate entities and select liaisons within the international community, religious groups, etc., the briefing claims.</p>

<p><strong>(PUBLIC DOMAIN)</strong> - <strong>April 2001</strong> — Ex Lockheed Skunkworks, USAF and CIA contractor Don Phillips claims Lockheed has extraterrestrial technology and “tremendous technological advances” have come from their study. Phillips states Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch is “getting pretty close” to what is going on, and adds that there is “a lot” going on in Utah, including where some of “our” associate scientists are working on UAP related technologies at private laboratories.</p>
<p>Phillips also said he started a company Light City Technologies Inc. where he mentions doing UAP related work and having access to certain technologies. He also suggests the company partnered with EG&amp;G and contracted scientists to do work for them; it is unknown if those same scientists owned private labs in Utah where this work was being done.</p>

<p><strong>(PUBLIC DOMAIN)</strong> - <strong>9 May 2001</strong> — Aerospace illustrator Mark McCandlish testifies at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. that gravity propulsion research began in the 1950s and successfully reverse engineered recovered UAP to build three USG/USG contractor-made vehicles by 1981 and was kept secret. McCandlish describes their propulsion matches early concepts by Thomas Townsend Brown using electrogravitics.</p>
<p>McCandlish states he saw three antigravity saucers in a hanger at Norton Air Force Base allegedly called “Flux Liners.” He also claims Lockheed Martin at one time possessed a flying triangle shaped like a dart that flew with the blunt end forward, found in a crash retrieval operation in East Germany in 1989.</p>

<p><strong><em>Note</em></strong>: Thomas Townsend Brown served on the initial board of governors for U.S. civilian UAP research organization NICAP with Col. Robert B. Emerson, RADM Delmer S. Fahrney, Gen. William E. Kepner and Brig. Gen. Thomas B. Catron among others. While McCandlish states the UAP he saw were based off of Brown’s research, more recent studies by mainstream scientists show no anti-gravity effects and attribute the phenomena to ionic drift. NASA has studied Brown’s claims and found no anti gravitic force. It is unclear if McCandlish, an illustrator, was simply wrong about the reverse engineered craft’s theoretical construct and they do exist, or if he is fabricating the information.</p>

Boeing
states this technology could impact space launch systems, artificial gravity on spacecraft, aircraft propulsion and fuelless electricity generation.</p>
<p>GRASP documents also state the work could be engineered into a radical weapon; high-power experiments using an “impulse gravity generator” can produce a beam of “gravity-like” energy that can exert instantaneous force of 1,000g on any object, enough to vaporize it. Boeing GRASP documents state its examination of Podkletnov’s work show a gravity beam laboratory in Russia can already repel objects up to 200 kilometers away, something that could be used as a ballistic missile shield or anti-satellite weapon.</p>
<p>Boeing attempted to work with Podkletnov directly but were not allowed to due to Russian technology transfer controls.

<p><strong>(PUBLIC DOMAIN)</strong> - <strong>16 October 2002</strong> — EarthTech International employee Dr. Eric Davis, author of several <strong>AATIP</strong> products years later, allegedly meets with VADM Thomas R. Wilson in a car outside of EG&amp;G Special Projects in Las Vegas. Davis transcribes the interaction where he was told the following: VADM Wilson found records of a UAP reverse engineering program using technology “not of this Earth,” it was protected by a special agreement between the DOD Special Access Program Oversight Committee (SAPOC)’s Senior Review Group (SRG) and a large defense contractor he would not disclose.</p>
<p>Wilson states Gen. Michael Ward tells him to go to a special projects record group in OUSDAT files not belonging to usual SAP, but rather a group of special legacy holdover programs from before SAP restructuring efforts of the early 1990s. Wilson has this confirmed by OUSDAT officer Paul Kaminski, Director of SAPCO Brig. Gen. Mike Kostelnik and SecDef William J. Perry that the special records group exists and is UAP related. It is a special subset of waived carve-out SAPs obfuscated in the records by cover SAPs containing false descriptions. Wilson seemingly narrows down four UAP related SAPs and has these confirmed by Kaminski, Kostelnik and Perry, who tell him he has the correct contractor, only described as an undisclosed aerospace contractor, “one of the top ones in the US with intelligence in its portfolio.” Wilson states Perry wanted an investigation into cost overruns at the programs but was told to drop it by an undisclosed party.</p>
<p>Wilson next calls a program manager attached to the records group, who is joined by a security director and a corporate attorney, who are surprised when he discovered their program(s) are actually
UAP related (Wilson asks them about crashed UFOs and MJ-12). Wilson states they tell him they’re a “watch committee” of sorts, organized after an audit almost blew their cover, and a special agreement was struck between them, the auditor and SAPOC SRG to prevent disclosure in the future.</p>
<p>Wilson is invited to a facility, undisclosed, and meets the three individuals in a secure vault and is given a tour of the program He sees a bigot list 1990-1993 that has no Executive Branch, no staffers, no Clinton/Bush administrations, a few recognized names from OUSDAT, one from NSC and another Pentagon SES employee; most names were corporate scientists and engineers. Wilson is told it was not a weapons, intelligence or special ops program, it was a reverse engineering program from “something recovered years ago in the past,” technological hardware, an intact craft they believed could fly through space/water/air/dimensions. The PM next tells Wilson it is likely “not of this Earth, not made by human hands.” He is told the program had very slow progress and there was no collaboration.</p>
<p>Wilson next states he meets the SRG twice and asks for formal access to the four SAPs and is denied, and told by a leader in the SRG that if he doesn’t drop the matter, he will get early retirement and lose 1-2 stars. Wilson also states he talks to USDAT Jacques Gansler about the matter, who tells him UFOs are “real,” but alien abductions are not. Gansler also tells Wilson to drop the matter.</p>
<p>At the end of Davis’ and Wilson’s meeting, the contractor TRW is mentioned in relation to a Hughes Aircraft attorney Jeffrey W. Griffith and a client of his Mary Elizabeth Elliott. No additional context is given. Names not mentioned in the notes but are relevant include others involved in SAPOC or the SRG at the time: Noel Longuemare Jr., John P. White, John J. Hamre, William F. Moore, Richard “Dick” Williams and Gansler. Others involved in SAPOC who may be aware of the special agreement at the time of the SAP restructuring include John Deutch, Walter Slocombe, William A. Owens, Emmett Paige Jr., Lin Wells, John Ellis, Charles Bill Moore, Kostelnik and Kaminski.</p>

<p>U.S. Army and NASA computers over the previous two years. McKinnon claims an image held at the Johnson Space Center’s Building 8 showed a “cigar shaped”object floating above the northern hemisphere in low-Earth orbit. McKinnon also stated he found an Excel document on a NASA server titled “non-terrestrial officers” that had the ranks and names of unknown USAF personnel. Another sheet had tabs for “material transfers between ships,” and when McKinnon tried to search the names of the ships, he did not find any corroboration in the PUBLIC DOMAIN. “ McKinnon used the program Landsearch to search files and folders on every machine. “</p>

<p><strong>(PUBLIC DOMAIN)</strong> - <strong>22 March 2003</strong> — Stanford professor Peter Sturrock confides to Jacques Vallée that he believes Hal Puthoff’s work on zero point energy is full of “circular arguments.” Sturrock mentions Puthoff points to the significance of the ratio e/m but failed to see that he’s also redefining mass. Sturrock says he’s sent Bernard Haisch at Lockheed Martin six questions like that but Haisch never responded. Vallee says he fails to understand Puthoff’s argument as well.</p>

The metal consisted of zinc and iron in an unusual ratio. Green says the samples arrived in CIA possession in 1982 and re-analyzed at Los Alamos, to which it was concluded it was an
aluminum-titanium alloy not from Earth. In 1992, Green used resources at General Motors (while serving as executive director of materials research) to study the sample. Green’s work at GM corroborated the material was titanium and aluminum.</p>

<p><strong>(PUBLIC DOMAIN)</strong> - <strong>11 June 2003</strong> — NASA engineer Larry Lemke tells Lockheed scientist Bernard Haisch, as relayed to Jacques Vallée, that Lemke’s father worked on advanced hardware that “seemed to have come from beyond Earth.” Lemke and other unnamed sources tell Haisch that there are now four projects dealing with UAP matters, dispersed among USG contractor facilities.</p>
<p><strong>(PUBLIC DOMAIN)</strong> - <strong>July 2003</strong> — Civilian Dion Fuller claims he met “Lee” at an apartment complex in Pacific Beach, CA, after he had allegedly gone AWOL from nearby Camp Pendleton, stolen 25 pairs of night vision goggles, a pistol from Iraq, a DOD laptop and an entire truck; Fuller states Lee scrolled through allegedly classified files on the laptop in front of him marked TOP SECRET and soon after, Fuller claims three NCIS agents arrived and searched the premises, detained him for six days and threatened him before letting him go.</p>
<p>In the following months, Fuller claims he was followed by military-looking men with the following license plates: 4U49864 (white truck), 5DA726 (white sedan), 4WEP4HEP852 (brown Honda),
SE4JPL (white Toyota), 5BEA709 (Escape), 4EPW827 (black Acura), 809-E2G (Forerunner), 4AMP126 (white Toyota) and 4JPL825 (Xterra SE).</p>
<p>Fuller later meets Richard Schowengerdt, founder of <strong>Project Chameleo</strong>, who claims he has successfully developed a technique to make men invisible; his research is more advanced than work by “Tachi” or Duke University; Schowengerdt’s research has been used in the field of electromagnetics working at the Navy Metrology Engineering Center (MEC), the Naval Sea Systems Command Technical Representative Office (NAVSEA TECHREP AEGIS), and with the Naval Reserve at the Miramar Naval Air Station and the Naval Air Station in Pt. Mugu.</p>
<p>As of 2015, he worked with Northrop Grumman working on the EA-18G Growler; his private experiments with electro-optical camouflage began in 1987 and took shape in 1993 with <strong>Project Chameleo</strong>, securing Patent No. 5,307,162 “Cloaking Using Optoelectronically Controlled Camouflage” in 1994. Fuller believes SAIC may be responsible for harassment by seemingly invisible individuals and this may be connected to the “MiLAB &#39;&#39; phenomena, i.e. fake alien abductions.</p>
<p>Schowengerdt states the Chief of Naval Operations Strategic Studies Group visited him in 2005 to determine if his technology could be applied by the year 2025; during a presentation at a Military Sensing Symposium in Charleston, SC, he states he was giving a presentation for Army, Navy, Air Force and contractor personnel and halfway through, the moderator told him someone in the audience claimed he was revealing Top Secret information when he mentioned a “chameleonic” Future Soldier program; he states he wasn’t aware anything like that was operational; he was then detained by 3-4 personnel who made him prove the information was in the PUBLIC DOMAIN.</p>
<p>Schowengerdt states as of 2005 he worked with the Defense Contract Management Agency in El Segundo, and his supervisor knew of <strong>Project Chameleo</strong>; he states this technology not only can render a craft or a person invisible but it can project a rendering of something else like a tree or an animal for psychological warfare purposes; he states it’s possible this sort of technology could be advanced in a black project through reverse engineered UAP R&D; he also states he believes information about the UAP issue has been “leaked” in a controlled manner since the 1950s.</p>
<p>When Schowengerdt hears of Fuller’s claims of invisible harassment, he suggests SAIC “may have stolen [his] idea…I really do,” adding he had a meeting with an individual from SAIC in 1995-96; he states SAIC had come up with similar chameleonic cloaking technology in isolation; he states SAIC had a contract with the Army at that time; he adds he wouldn’t be surprised if the technology is being experimented covertly on Americans; he states he gave the Navy a tour of his lab and they were impressed but as of 2005 he did not have a contract with them.</p>

Puthoff states that the ATP Group in the 1980s, sponsored by BDM Corp. and led by Col John Alexander, was killed because “there was already another project.” Puthoff states it was “deeply black” and “somebody” didn’t want it exposed or duplicated.</p>
<p>Puthoff also shows Vallee the VADM Thomas Wilson notes on this date and states they were written by Eric Davis. Puthoff says to “join” the project you have to have something major to contribute. “What are our chances? We don’t even know who the major contractor is,” he says. Vallee believes Wilson may be polygraphed at his next job as President of ATK Missiles because he may have leaked privileged information to Davis. Vallee also states he is told that the program was inside government but under Nixon it was transferred to a private contractor to secure it.</p>

<p><strong>(PUBLIC DOMAIN)</strong> - <strong>March 2004</strong> — Huntsville, AL company Transdimensional Technologies LLC states it is working on anti-gravitic technology for commercial applications and references UAP in a press release. Founder Jeff Cameron states the company is working with NASA and it is exploring transportation, military and space travel applications of its “Power Cubed” technology. The company obtains investment from local Huntsville businessmen Remigrius Shatas and Robert Asprey (founders of Cyber Corp., later Avocent), and additional investment from 2C Computing and local venture capital firm R&amp;R Ventures, of which Asprey was also a partner. The company’s state filings are still active but its website is no longer online and it no longer provides updates to the public on its antigravity research. It was located at 906-E Bob Wallace Ave., Huntsville, AL 35801.</p>
<p>An archived version of the company’s website also shows it was developing a non-lethal weapon known as Medusa and a gravitational wave propulsion system. It suggests clients include military and NASA, and the Power Cubed propellantless propulsion rotor was developed on contract with NASA MSFC (H31066D).</p>

<p><strong>(PUBLIC DOMAIN)</strong> - <strong>June 2004</strong> — Former Assistant Secretary of Housing and Urban Development <a href="https://home.solari.com/">Catherine Austin Fitts</a> writes in a paper that a “large proportion of the nation’s wealth is being illegally diverted…into secret, unaccountable channels” to support clandestine domestic military R&amp;D. She claims that while at HUD, she came across evidence to suggest IT/accounting systems providers Lockheed Martin Information Systems, Dyncorp and AMS Inc. were responsible for the obfuscation and may have data on where missing DOD/HUD funds were siphoned to. Fitts also claims that complaints about AMS were answered by the Pentagon with its hire of IBM, but IBM in turn, subcontracted AMS, Lockheed, Dyncorp, SAIC and Accenture to manage the systems that failed a GAO audit.</p>
<p>Fitts also claims AMS violated fiduciary and control practices by “installing its own equipment and software with no parallel runs against the legacy software and accounting system.” AMS was hired by HUD in 1996 to manage internal accounting and financial controls and Fitts claims while she was at HUD, AMS’s actions led to $76 billion in undocumentable transactions.</p>

<p><strong><em>Note</em></strong>: To more deeply probe the connections between wealthy entrepreneurial families and funding of possibly rogue UAP projects, one would want to look at linkages between: (1) all members of those families, (2) all front companies linked to those families and (3) all meetings held by those families and the aerospace world. If intermediary funding mechanisms are used one would also want to look for linkages between those families and organizations that may fund aerospace related projects. See possible example: the Lindbergh Foundation (see 3 December 1999).</p>

<p><strong>(PUBLIC DOMAIN)</strong> - <strong>7 August 2004</strong> — Former NIDS contractor Jim Westwood tells Jacques Vallée that Charles Bowsher, former Comptroller General under President Reagan, states he found a “crashed UFO program” during a large audit of classified programs. Bowsher uncovered it in 1984-85, which he called a “bizarre special access program coverup which surely violated every classification, executive order, regulation, and Congressional rule.” Bowsher considered turning it over to the Department of Justice for prosecution, but an unnamed powerful individual in the DOD squashed it. Bowsher said the program had to do with an “exotic, non-Earthly vehicle.”</p>

<p><strong>(PUBLIC DOMAIN)</strong> - <strong>2004</strong> — Ufologist Bill Cooper claims underground bases under control of Naval Intelligence utilize cooperation between aliens and humans in Utah, New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado and Nevada. Cooper claims some are built beneath Native American reservations for cover, something the research of Danny Casolaro into Wackenhut also seems to suggest (see 1 August 1993).</p>
<p>Cooper also claims a secret fund was organized and kept by the Military Office of the White House in the 1950s, specifically the White House Underground Construction Fund by President Eisenhower, that assisted the building of underground military bases for human-alien collaboration and for general operations of a UAP control group “MJ-12.” Cooper claims Rep. George Mahon, Rep. Robert Sikes and Rep. Jim Wright knew of the effort.</p>
<p>Cooper also claims money was transferred from the top-secret fund to a location at Palm Beach, FL belonging to the Coast Guard called Peanut Island, a property near a facility owned by Joseph Kennedy. Cooper also claims Eisenhower set up Majority Twelve through NSC 5410 as cover, its names having changed to the Special Group under Kennedy, the 40 Committee under Nixon, Ford and Carter, and the PI-40 Committee under Reagan. Alleged Study Group members include Gordon Dean, Zbigniew Brzezinksi, Henry Kissinger and 34 others, and meetings were allegedly held at Marine Base Quantico, VA where the group was known as “Quantico II.” The meetings were held using the code name “The Country Club.”</p>
<p>Cooper claims these meetings led to the creation of <strong>Project Joshua</strong> and <strong>Project Excalibur</strong>, and that Rand Corporation was involved in the construction of underground facilities, and that the illegal drug trade using smuggling operations from Zapata Oil assisted in funding.</p>

USAF personnel were advised to stay away but for the entirety of the week, the hangar was empty. One night during that week, the flight line was evacuated, the base was locked down and USAF personnel were advised to stay inside and away from the windows to protect an incoming classified aircraft.</p>
<p>Walker states despite listening for it, over the next half-hour, he heard no tires hitting the pavement, no brakes, no engine, no idling or anything. After 30 minutes they were cleared to go back outside after the aircraft landed, but they saw no signs of anything that happened. Walker states he experienced something similar at Dyess Air Force Base in Abilene, Texas. He does not speculate on what the aircrafts were, but states other personnel he has spoken to share similar experiences that are “brushes with black projects,” some bordering on myth and “utter absurdity.”</p>

<p><strong>(PUBLIC DOMAIN)</strong> - <strong>October 2006</strong> — Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory physicist “Henry Deacon” (pseudonym) claims he is employed by a three-letter agency and that black budget physics is decades ahead of physics in the open source. Deacon claims <strong>Project Shiva Nova</strong> uses arrays of lasers and creates rips in the fabric of space-time; Deacon claims this lets “things” like beings, influences and “all kinds of weird stuff” come into our present reality.</p>
<p>Deacon claims USG knowledge of probable and possible futures is highly classified and attempts to meddle in space-time creates more issues; time loops, rips, etc. Deacon claims UAP occupants on Earth are time travelers, and that experiments at Montauk, NY were real, but that claims by Al Bielek and others may be disinformation or incorrect. Deacon states Montauk was a “real mess…they created a time split we’re still unable to mend…this also relates to <strong>Project Rainbow</strong>.” Deacon claims jump rooms exist and that they’re naturally occurring and a stable one exists between locations on Earth and Mars.</p>
<p>Deacon corroborates testimony by Dan Burisch, who claims ET groups are concerned about affecting Earth’s current timeline for different outcomes they are interested in. Deacon claims <strong>Project Looking Glass</strong> may have been real and utilizes time viewing technology given to USG by ET. Deacon claims some ET groups are our own ancestors from different futures and nuclear weapons testing and high energy physics testing has created “time loops upon time loops, it’s all a mess.”</p>
<p>Deacon states there are a number of parallel timelines, lots of branches; and to the USG knowledge, there are no paradoxes. If the past is changed, it creates a different timeline, a new branch of the original one.</p>

<p><strong>(PUBLIC DOMAIN)</strong> - <strong>2008</strong> — Dan Burisch claims to have been a microbiologist working at Papoose Lake Facility/S4 and claims to have been involved in a <strong>Project Aquarius</strong> investigating an extraterrestrial entity “J-Rod” and its neuropathy. Burisch claims he was a pro-tem member of Majestic-12, MJ-9, and dealt with “extraterrestrial human lineage and time travel information.”</p>
<p>He claims <strong>Project Looking Glass</strong> involved a reverse engineered time viewing device, and that there were three extraterrestrial groups visiting Earth: the P45s, humans from approximately 45,000 years in the future that were pale and “grey alien” in appearance, having lived in an apocalyptic Earth; the P52s
from 52,000 years in the future of similar appearance and the P52 Orions, who are human looking and spiritual. Burisch claims the P45s and P52 stayed on Earth after a catastrophe and the P52 Orions left Earth for the Moon and later Mars. Burisch claims the P45s are intent on justifying their history and want the catastrophe to occur, while the P52s and P52 Orions do not. Burisch also claims a <strong>Project Lotus</strong> is attempting to utilize ET technology to manipulate human DNA and RNA.</p>

He states there were rooms that were designed in a way to trigger bad trips when the subjects were on LSD because there was a belief that trauma could improve a user’s psi abilities.

<p><strong>(PUBLIC DOMAIN)</strong> - <strong>October 2008</strong> — JASON Group’s Program Office, run out of the MITRE Corp., publishes a technical report evaluating the national security significance of high frequency gravitational waves (HFGW). The report concludes national security and aerospace applications of HFGW are not possible and wrong. Two years later, HFGW was the subject of a Defense Intelligence Reference Document produced for the Defense Intelligence Agency’s Advanced Aerospace Weapon Systems Applications Program (<strong>AAWSAP</strong>), which concluded HFGW could be used for interplanetary navigation. It is unknown but likely HFGW was deemed UAP-affiliated subject matter due to its inclusion in the <strong>AAWSAP</strong> program.</p>
<p>It is possible JASON was tasked to debunk HFGW because the responsible party listed on the SF298 for MITRE’s contract was Dr. Ronald Pandolfi, of CIA. Ten years later (see 26 February 2019),
Pandolfi was sued by FOX TV producer Robert Kiviat for allegedly running a disinformation scheme to frame public perception of the UAP issue.</p>
<p>A response to the JASON paper from the author of the <strong>AAWSAP</strong> paper, Robert Baker of GravWave LLC, accuses the JASON analysis of making several serious errors including a failure to review all available peer-reviewed literature. When asked if JASON had a “preconceived agenda to discredit HFGW research,” Baker and GravWave responded: “it is difficult to believe otherwise.”</p>

The witness “Derek Jones” sees a large triangular UAP and four smaller spherical UAP above his backyard. When “Jones” attempts to photograph it, the device fails. When he points a flashlight at the triangle, it responds with a beam of blue-white light on him for 3 seconds, causing burning and later, hair loss and lumps on his legs, groin and back diagnosed as
non-malignant lymphoma. The same day the DHS personnel first interview “Jones,” he hears low-flying helicopters near his property. One of the men is armed and they produce no identification.</p>
<p>They tell him not to mention the sighting to anyone, and take detailed notes and diagrams of Jones’ description of the triangle. “Jones” reported the license plate to Bigelow Aerospace Advanced Space Studies (<strong>BAASS</strong>), a contractor for the Defense Intelligence Agency’s Advanced Aerospace Weapon Systems Applications Program (<strong>AAWSAP</strong>). <strong>BAASS</strong> tracks the license plate to a DHS carpool.</p>

It was barely beneath the surface when he saw it, white and 20 feet in length, and quickly “darted” into the depths. “It was definitely a solid object, but when it descended, its forward end rapidly collapsed in on itself and disappeared.” Baughman told his work center supervisor about the UAP, to which he was not debriefed and was not told
to file a report. The supervisor told him “everyone sees weird shit in the ocean.” The event likely did not make its way into Navy or <strong>UAPTF</strong> reporting channels or Congress prior to it being disclosed to a journalist in 2021.</p>

Within 24 hours, three large black SUVs pulled into the area, wearing black suits and dark glasses, Mover stated. The men told the crowd “you would be well advised not to talk about this incident in the future…it will be in your interests not to speak about this incident again” in a threatening tone. Three months later, the rural Kentucky community was mysteriously equipped with state of the art electrical transformers that upgraded the infrastructure of the town.

<p><strong>(PUBLIC DOMAIN)</strong> - <strong>31 March 2011</strong> — Author Nick Redfern states he calls a representative of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska. The representative tells him he can meet with the “Collins Elite,” a group of current and former intelligence community personnel who believe UAP are demonic in origin. The Collins Elite allegedly believes all UAP are demonic and should not be contacted. Redfern was given this information by a “Richard Duke” and was given “the Collins Report,” which is allegedly a briefing document from the 1980s that lays out the group’s theories.</p>
<p>Duke claims the group established the belief that UAP are interdimensional and demonic when the FBI, AFOSI and other agencies began investigating physicist Jack Parsons for his links to Aleister Crowley and L. Ron Hubbard, and Parsons’ allegiance to the United States. Parsons was a principal founder of the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Aerojet Engineering Corporation, and led the California branch of the Thelemite Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO) in the 1940s.</p>
<p>Duke claims some in the US IC believed Parsons and his occult practices were responsible for some UAP sightings, alleging occult rituals were responsible for the channeling of specific UAP events or the “opening” of entry points where more UAP would enter afterward. Duke also claims early members of the Collins Elite were asked by some in the CIA Directorate of Plans in 1952 to determine if UAP had demonic origin. Some <strong>Project Blue Book</strong> cases at the time reminded some CIA officials of ghosts, demons, etc. Duke claims members eventually included AFOSI, NSA and CIA, and other agencies.</p>
<p>Redfern states Duke and other sources informed him that CIA and Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) personnel attempted to contact entities “Affa” and “Ponnar,” but those attempts allegedly failed. Officials were concerned with eschatalogical forecasts discussed in occult circles, but the forecasts never came to fruition. Duke also claims in the late 1960s, the work of Sidney Gottleib in the Technical Services Staff (CIA TSS) and work by Donald Ewen Cameron was taken up by scientists attached to the CIA’s Office of Research and Development, who attempted to harness “demonic powers” for espionage purposes under <strong>Operation Often</strong>.</p>
<p>Duke claims <strong>Operation Often</strong> and Collins Elite personnel used a cover story that they were US Army psychologists working on a project for the University of South Carolina to understand mental trauma in military personnel; the group’s actual goal was to analyze the nightmares of Paul Garratt after a near-death experience. Garratt told Often personnel after seeing a tunnel of bright light, he was taken to a colder place that was never-ending, flat, light blue and filled with naked screaming human beings; above them were hundreds of saucer-like UAP that “pulsed and throbbed” as if they were living and breathing. Garratt claimed he was in turmoil watching this and saw small “balls of light” fly from the bodies of the people into the saucers. Often personnel concluded the NDE suggested saucers might be harvesting human souls and they were demonic in nature.</p>
<p>Duke claims in the 1980s, President Ronald Reagan was briefed on UAP from different perspectives, including the Collins Elite on the demonic UAP theory, the CIA Science and Technology division on the extraterrestrial/genetic agenda theory, and an Air Force psychologist who argued abductions were not real and the result of the human subconscious. Reagan gravitated to the Collins Elite explanation, and funded a deeper investigation into the phenomenon that concluded abductions were a demonic deception.</p>

Those met are the “keepers of the secrets,” who treat Bell and Mover rudely and told “no, and hell no” when asked. Bell and Mover later told <strong>BAASS</strong> that they believed advanced technology was being held at aerospace contractor facilities under government supervision. Mover and Bell became fearful of moving forward.

<p><strong>(PUBLIC DOMAIN)</strong> - <strong>June 2013</strong> — Stealth aircraft researcher Joseph Jones claims <strong>Project Brilliant Buzzard</strong> was a codename used for airborne surveillance and tracking during the SDI program of the 1980s; he claims it dealt with the concept of setting up an electromagnetic shield around the US using a large boomerang shaped craft that could loiter over US cities. Jones states the primary contractor was Boeing and JP Aerospace was a subcontractor, and that DARPA issued a contract to an unknown contractor to develop SEAGEL, a material 95% lighter than styrofoam used as the primary building material for triangular/boomerang shaped craft.</p>

<p><strong>(PUBLIC DOMAIN)</strong> - <strong>1 November 2013</strong> — Ret. USMC Cpt. Bill Uhouse states he worked at Wright-Patterson AFB doing flight testing of exotic experimental aircraft. Over the next 30 years, Uhouse claims he worked for defense contractors as a pilot in a “flying disc simulator” and in actual flying discs. Uhouse states in 1962-63 the simulator became operational and was based on a recovered disc landing from Kingman, AZ from 1952-53. Uhouse states the craft was “presented” to the USG.</p>
<p>Uhouse states the craft was taken to Area 51 early in its construction and four “alien” occupants went to Los Alamos upon delivery of the craft to A51. He also states the ET assisted human physicists and engineers in reverse engineering efforts.</p>

He claims Gen. Curtis LeMay told him there was a UAP crash at Roswell, NM, and an NSA source told him Henry Kissinger, George H. W. Bush and Ronald Reagan were aware of the UAP cover-up. He also claims a friend of his at Boeing was involved in a UAP crash recovery and saw ET bodies.</p>
<p>A.H. also claims an underground base is maintained for testing ET technology in Utah reachable only by air, along with locations in Enzo, CA, Lancaster, CA, Edwards AFB, March AFB and Eglin AFB. He claims “35% to 40%” of UAP work was moved from Area 51 to Utah.</p>

<p><strong>(PUBLIC DOMAIN)</strong> - <strong>March 2014</strong> — The US Navy’s <strong>In-House Laboratory Independent Research Program</strong> mentions in a public budget document it has been researching the use of metamaterials to disperse and control electromagnetic waves in the microwave (RF) spectrum. Budget documents show DOD supercomputer resources were used and polyurea silicate composites were analyzed. One application of this is for aerospace mass reduction (see April 2017). In 2017 the Navy combined this program with others and it is difficult to track if the metamaterial research continues today.</p>

<p><strong><em>Note</em></strong>: Bismuth telluride and lead telluride have thermoelectric properties, and cadmium telluride has photovoltaic properties. Pure germanium is a semiconductor and the first metallic material (discovered in 2005) to become a superconductor in the presence of an EM field was an alloy of germanium, uranium and rhodium. Palladium is used as a key material in capacitors. The materials Bushman suggests were included in the UAP could be used to create a thermoelectrical/photovoltaic generator with a semiconductor and capacitor.</p>

<p><strong>(PUBLIC DOMAIN)</strong> - <strong>December 2014</strong> — A documentary is released that interviews aerospace illustrator Mark McCandlish, who claims a friend of his, Bradford Sorensen, saw a man-made disc-shaped craft at Norton Air Force Base in 1988. Brad states the first generation Aurora was also at the airshow in a hangar, and states he accidentally got access to a section of a hangar reserved for a private showing that displayed a “Fluxliner,” aka an Alien Reproduction Vehicle (ARV). He states there were “three” flying saucers that looked like “something from the 1950s.” Brad gave McCandlish all of the details of what he saw, of which McCandlish made drawings of them. There was a small, medium and large sized ARV that were “hovering” above the floor of the hangar. A three star general presented a film of an ARV “hopping” over a desert scene before taking off vertically quickly; the general also allegedly said the ARVs were capable of light speed or better.</p>
<p>Lt. Col. John Williams also states while at Norton AFB he heard rumors that one facility that was “close hold” that contained one “UFO craft.” Williams states it was a location where people could come to Norton and see the craft. McCandlish also states Hal Puthoff explained to him how zero point energy could be used to propel a craft; it is unknown if Puthoff believed a craft was stored at Norton.</p>
<p>McCandlish also states he was threatened on the phone for talking about the ARV and states he was the subject of an IRS audit. He states much of the technology could be overlooked/exempt from FOIA because it’s held in private industry.</p>
<p>The film also states “free energy” researchers Stefan Marinov in Austria fell out of a window in 1997, cold fusion expert Eugene Mallove died of blunt force trauma in 2004 before a presentation, zero point energy physicist Arie deGeus died in a parked car in 2007 before a trip to secure funding, zero point energy Stardrive patent Mark Tomion died unexpectedly in 2009 after corresponding with McCandlish.</p>
<p>McCandlish was reported to be found dead of suspicious circumstances in 2021.</p>
<p>The filmmaker who created this movie, James Allen, died of heavy metal poisoning three months after the film finished editing.</p>

<p><strong>(PUBLIC DOMAIN)</strong> - <strong>30 January 2015</strong> — Retired US Navy Petty Officer First Class flight Engineer “Brian” tells ufologist Linda Moulton Howe he saw a large hole to an underground facility 5-10 miles from the geographic South Pole; he states the area was supposed to be a no fly zone but during an emergency medevac, they flew through the area. He also states at a camp near Marie Byrd Land, 10-15 scientists “disappeared for two weeks” on assignment and when they re-appeared “their faces looked scared,” and he claims he saw silver UAP near the Transantarctic Mountain range in 1995-96 while he was flying on assignment. After seeing the hole in the ice, an “intelligence-gathering” type of individual sat his crew down and told them “OK, you guys saw this thing, but you did not see it.”</p>
<p>Eighteen months after sharing his story, “Brian” claims he received an anonymous phone call that told him not to talk about the missing scientists and “certain people” would prefer that he not talk about it. The phone number was not blocked; he searched it after the call and it came up as a number associated with the NSA in Fort Meade, MD, he claims.</p>

DeLonge states he was told “the Others” are manipulating countries against the US/West hegemony.</p>

<p><strong>(PUBLIC DOMAIN)</strong> - <strong>April 2016</strong> — Tom DeLonge states he was told by unnamed “advisors” that there were multiple UAP crashes and recoveries. The USG and its contractors hid it, created a “pickup game” of counter intelligence, DeLonge claims, and adds that it was at one time bigger than the Manhattan Project. He states it is currently held by a private corporation where “certain laws” protect their own breakthroughs and proprietary assets; DeLonge adds that he asked the advisors if the crash recovery program(s) were legal, or if they were illegal. He claims the advisors showed him an “exact law,” with an exact paragraph and number on a “government website” to justify what they were doing as legal.</p>

<p><strong>(PUBLIC DOMAIN)</strong> - <strong>5 April 2016</strong> — Sekret Machines: Book 1, Chasing Shadows is released by authors Tom DeLonge and AJ Hartley. DeLonge claims his “advisors” from the US intelligence community and Executive Branch helped him shape the information in it and it is fiction with concepts that are true. The main tenets of Sekret Machines are as follows:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>  Dreamland/Area 51 has a man-made flying saucer</li>
<li>  The UAP R&amp;D work at Area 51 is entirely a subdivision of a major aerospace contractor within a location called “Possum Plant”</li>
<li>  Area 51 had a triangle Astra-TR3B called “the Locust” that exploits curvature in spacetime</li>
<li>  S4 near Area 51 had a simulator for the Locust</li>
<li>  A fictional “Maynard Corporation” was laundering money through an entity called “SWEEP,” a network of funding streams tied to aerospace concerns around the world dedicated to R&amp;D and operation</li>
<li>  SWEEP includes the fraudulent tagging of private land as hosts to endangered species so it can be utilized for R&amp;D purposes</li>
<li>  A breakaway group exists with a large amount of money and no national allegiance that maintains total control over the disparate projects</li>
<li>  Russia has their own back engineered craft and operates it on behalf of someone else</li>
<li>  The US operation for reverse engineered UAP craft is “beyond black”</li>
<li>  The enforcement of SWEEP utilizes personnel who pose as government agents including for the EPA</li>
<li>  “Alien” abductions are faked to psychologically traumatize witnesses of black projects and cover the human element</li>
<li>  A disc was held at an old Creech AFB underground hangar away from S4</li>
<li>  A human piloted saucer engaged an ET piloted sphere and shot it down</li>
<li>  Military officials involved in the projects believe ET were interpreted as “Greek gods” in ancient history</li>
</ul>
<p>Former CIA official Jim Semivan states he and colleagues were concerned this book was written after a leak of classified information because “it had some very interesting data in it.” Semivan later says he realized there was no leak, DeLonge just “put two and two together.”</p>

<p><strong>(PUBLIC DOMAIN)</strong> - <strong>27 March 2017</strong> — Anonymous website partially encoded publishes an article on “turning the vehicle into a pilot’s prosthetic extension.” In the article are vague examples of how to replicate the piloting features of a UAP: “there must be no difference between the aircraft and the crew…you cannot just take a human being and fit him with all this array of sensors; you first need to tweak the human somehow to better exploit the capabilities of this technology…we need to go a step further from the current paradigm of manned aircrafts and shift toward a paradigm of aircrafts that behave like a human.” Elsewhere on the site, allegedly non-public reports from Raytheon and Lockheed are cited.</p>
<p>Another article from 20 December 2017 writes that USAF pilots are trained to be aware of UAP, shares a seemingly non-public FLIR image dated 11 November 2014 and states: “we want our enemies to believe in UFOs up to the point it becomes too late for them to react to an airstrike by our own air force; we also need our pilots not to believe in UFOs should the enemy use this same strategy against us.”</p>

<p><strong>(PUBLIC DOMAIN)</strong> - <strong>April 2017</strong> — USAF Maj. Brain Hans, Maj. Christopher Jefferson and Maj. Joshua Wehrle of the Curtis LeMay Center for Doctrine Development and Education at Maxwell AFB publish a framework to “leverage advanced propulsion” for deep space travel. Specifically the framework cites the work of James Woodward (see June 2001) of Cal State and Paul March of Lockheed Martin Space Operations using lead zirconate titanate (PZT), a piezoelectric compound, to achieve mass reduction for aerospace applications.</p>
<p>The framework states laboratory experiments confirm the findings that PZT can achieve flight and could enable missions with no limitations experienced by conventional propulsion systems. The USAF authors also state the Aerospace Corporation concluded this research didn’t warrant government funding, but they disagree with that conclusion. They also mention EmDrive as another breakthrough propulsion technology opportunity that could “revolutionize” how USAF operates in deep space. They conclude more metamaterials are needed to continue this work and optimize aerospace mass education effects.</p>

Michael Carey, Lockheed Martin Skunk Works EVP Rob Weiss, Hillary Clinton campaign manager John Podesta, Dr. Hal Puthoff, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence Christopher K. Mellon and former OUSD(I) employee and <strong>AATIP</strong> head Luis Elizondo, among others unnamed, to carry out slow disclosure of UAP information to the American public from USG/USG contractor sources.</p>
<p>DeLonge claims USG/USG contractors already have free energy technology, i.e. zero-point energy, that would make all other forms of energy derivation obsolete. “One inch of air could power the
US for hundreds of years,” he claimed. DeLonge suggested his group, To The Stars Academy of Arts &amp; Science (TTSA), was being restrained from releasing all information government insiders were telling him, but that TTSA sought investment from private investors to develop said free energy technology for energy and aerospace purposes. DeLonge also stated TTSA expected to create a working anti-gravity craft; the company’s offering statement to the SEC stated the company’s aerospace division was “dedicated to finding revolutionary breakthroughs in propulsion, energy and communications.”</p>

<p><strong>(PUBLIC DOMAIN)</strong> - <strong>2 November 2017</strong> — Salvatore Pais of the Naval Air Station Patuxent River files a patent for a triangle/diamond shaped craft that has anti-gravitic effects and resembles some UAP sightings. The patent was initially rejected but Naval Aviation Enterprise CTO James Sheehy filed for appeal to the USPTO and stated “it will become a reality” and China was already investing in it. The patent was then approved. The technology described in Pais’ patent is similar to that of Hal Puthoff’s <strong>AATIP</strong> DIRD on vacuum engineering.

<p><strong>(PUBLIC DOMAIN)</strong> - <strong>2018</strong> — Former Lockheed Martin astrophysicist Bernard Haisch, a colleague of Eric Davis and Hal Puthoff, comments on four alleged “legacy” UAP programs hidden from oversight. “A group of four related but separate unacknowledged SCI programs dating back to a 1947 Truman memorandum still exist and were housed as of the 1990s in major aerospace companies such as for example Lockheed, TRW, Raytheon, Aerospace Corp. etc. These would be expensive programs since the cost of secrecy can be several times bigger than the research… the black programs collectively have budgets in the $10B range annually. Topics apparently include both reverse engineering and extraterrestrial biology.”</p>
<p>Haisch states “the <strong>AATIP</strong> program did find the UFO crash retrieval program via official channels, but was denied access to it because the <strong>AATIP</strong> itself is not a SAP. Sen. Harry Reid petitioned the DoD to confer SAP status to the <strong>AATIP</strong>, but the DoD denied his request.”</p>
<p>Haisch also states: “It is easier to keep a program hidden in a contractor facility than in a government facility…a crash retrieval or some classified continuation of <strong>Project Blue Book</strong> would likely exist as a deep, black industrial-based SAP. A program involving hardware would be considered technology rather than intelligence and most likely fall under the office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (OUSDAT). Ironically, for such a program, even someone having an intelligence “ticket” at the highest level would not be considered to have a need to know. All of this results in very effective isolation and virtually no one in a position of open civilian governmental
authority, being cognizant of this after a time even though at least in principle of the Special Access Program oversight committee, SAPOC, should be cognizant of such a program. I do not know of any fundamentally limiting factors in the potential longevity of a program. The extreme compartmentalization and limited oversight would tend to keep a program in existence, perhaps indefinitely. Political leaders come and go, pandering to the masses for votes in the eyes of many within the military and intelligence communities, and as a result have varying degrees of respect and trust in that world. Deep Black programs can become quite independent of any given administration, and it would certainly be unrealistic to assume that a given president has been briefed on every SAP. A president does not automatically have a need to know. Moreover, Freedom Of Information Act requests cannot penetrate Unacknowledged Special Access Programs.”</p>

<p>He also claims the Tic Tac metamaterial came from “Earth humans” from the future and people from the future come back in time to create “past events” which in turns create a “Novikov loop” (a paradox where the origin of the event cannot be known). Sarfatti claims he is close to Bechtel, was close to the Reagan Administration and former SDI proponent and SecDef Caspar Weinberger, and states he received phone calls from a “mechanical voice” when he was young that put him into a hypnotic state where he was led to theorize about quantum vacuum energy and faster-than-light propulsion.

<p><strong>(PUBLIC DOMAIN)</strong> - <strong>24 July 2020</strong> — A declassified briefing card utilized by the Navy’s Chief of Information and the Office of Information tells all personnel to “not refer to UAPs as UFOs. The latter term is intrinsically linked to the concept of extraterrestrials and the associated hysteria generated by the media that cover this topic.” It was prepared by Capt. Joseph F. Gradisher and OSD Public Affairs Susan Gough. The card suggests the Navy was attempting to avoid public discussion of the extraterrestrial hypothesis and had a strategic priority to avoid “hysteria.”</p>

I, and others in my circle, have discussed the topic with them of how one cannot find waived-unacknowledged SAPs that operate outside of Section 119 of Title 10. In fact, a DoD office can create a shell company and then transfer funds to it under an unremarkable commercial defense services contract. Then that shell company turns around and gives a subcontract to a third-party aerospace/defense firm that hosts a waived-unacknowledged SAP that operates outside of Sect. 119 of Title 10. This usually hides (making the audit trail terminate at the shell company) the flow of money going to the third party company that’s running a waived-unacknowledged SAP where a UAP crash retrieval program is hidden.”</p>

<p><strong>(PUBLIC DOMAIN)</strong> - <strong>25 June 2021</strong> — The ODNI’s report to Congressional Intelligence and Armed Services Committees on progress made by the <strong>Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force</strong> (<strong>UAPTF</strong>) is published. The <strong>UAPTF</strong> discloses (p2) it received input from USD(I&amp;S), DIA, FBI, NRO, NGA, NSA, Air Force, Army, Navy, Marine Corps, DARPA, FAA, NASA, NOAA, ODNI and presumably CIA, whose name is redacted.</p>
<p>Neither the Department of Energy (DOE) nor its agency the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) are mentioned as having contributed. This may be a meaningful omission, and may indicate classified aerospace programs or commercial aerospace programs linked to that agency, its offices, facilities or contractors were responsible for some of the 144 UAP cases analyzed.</p>
<p>In particular, one NNSA contractor, Triad National Security LLC based in Los Alamos, NM, filed a patent for aerospace vehicles that traveled inside self-generated “air-buoyant structures” made of low density aerogel or vapor-expanded material to achieve “buoyancy in air.” The patent was published two weeks before the <strong>UAPTF</strong> report was delivered to Congress and matches the description of at least one high-profile UAP case where a USN pilot told Lt. Ryan Graves he witnessed a “sphere encasing a cube” in 2014 over the Atlantic Ocean east of Virginia. The Triad National Security LLC patent states an
air-buoyant structure around a craft could be spherical, cylindrical, torus, pill or lattice shaped. Triad’s website states its primary client is the NNSA and it is comprised of three partners: Battelle Memorial Institute, The Texas A&amp;M University System and the University of California.</p>

Griffith.” Elliot knows something with respect to UAP and TRW that she will only share on her deathbed, they claim.</p>
<p>Jeffrey W. Griffith is the person ufologist Richard Dolan stated with “near certainty” was the author of the Sedge Masters/<strong>Zodiac</strong> crash recovery story, which Dolan also claimed was connected to TRW. Griffith’s biography shows he was the corporate counsel for Hughes Aircraft. Two co-founders of TRW (Ramo and Wooldridge) resigned from Hughes Aircraft in 1953 and eventually merged with Thompson Products to become TRW in 1965. Prior to the merger, Ramo-Wooldridge spun off Space Technology Laboratories (STL) into The Aerospace Corporation at the request of Congress in 1959.</p>

<p>Sheehan states when a flying saucer was discovered in New Mexico in 1947, it was brought to Wright Field and the “Anderson Trust” was established with trustees Robert Anderson, Robert Lovett and John Jay McCloy, all senior partners at Brown Brothers Harriman. Sheehan states a USG group, funded by the covert money from Brown Brothers Harriman, took custody of the UAP technology and “brought in major corporations” like Lockheed, Boeing, and others and “swore them to complete secrecy.” This group has since been allegedly trying to monopolize this technology and monopolize the information about the UAP occupants, etc. Sheehan states he does not know if the group has had diplomatic relations with the ET/UTs, but some witnesses he has spoken to tell him the group is engaging non-human entities.</p>

Puthoff also states it is possible fundamental physics knowledge is being withheld from the broader scientific community. Puthoff states it would be the case “if we have mastered anti-gravity, and they’re being built by aerospace corporations;
the new physics would have to be involved.” Puthoff claims something “is missing” from Einstein’s General Relativity, and what is missing would have the effect of manipulating gravity.</p>

It had been reported to me by not one but two sources that there&#39;ve been deliberate attempts to cause injury to people who are working on the periphery of that program and there was concern that some of the people are not being adequately protected….there&#39;s a concern that basically scientists working in
essentially research related to ongoing antigravitics research are suffering harassment from overseas intelligence services.&quot;
“In Huntsville, Alabama, USA there’s a very black program underway that was previously run by a Chinese-American scientist called Ning Li…there is a very active anti-gravity program…I’m told there is equally an extraordinarily aggressive and nasty Chinese counterintelligence operation underway, to try to find out as much as possible through harassment and simple things like poison. There’s an espionage
battle underway as we speak.”</p>

QM3 Karol Olesiak states it reminded him of a “burning bush,” and states the Office of the Watch and Conning Officer were not alarmed by the object. SN Derek Smith states the surface of the UAP was “swirling.”
Another witness, an anonymous Boatswain’s Mate of the Watch was in contact with all witnesses and saw the object himself, stating it was “translucent” like a “lava lamp,” “almost like viscous, but in the air, and it moved.” The BMOW corroborated Olesiak’s statement that the superior officers weren’t concerned by it and concluded they knew information “above my pay grade.” When the BMOW wrote the sighting into his log, he was told by his chief to “rip it out.”</p>

<p><strong><em>Note</em></strong>: This may be significant because it suggests the British MOD may have been in possession of photographic evidence of UAP it believed to be sourced from USG/USG contractor projects Aurora or Astra. Noted in 22 December 1992, British officials chose to monitor USAF communication that was concerned Secretary Donald B. Rice lied to Congress by stating Aurora didn’t exist. British interest in triangular UAP stems from several overflights of British airspace.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Note</em></strong>: There is nothing in declassified MOD records that suggests the Ministry tracked efforts by then SSCI Staff Director Chris Mellon on behalf of Sen. Robert Byrd to investigate the existence of Aurora, or efforts by Byrd’s counsel Richard D’Amato (see 22 May 1992). Mellon stated on the record “there is no such [secret U.S. triangular craft] program,” while D’Amato stated he believed triangular UAP were human made.

<p>The article claims a database known as “DOLYN” collects signature data of underwater fast movers, tic-tac kinetic vehicles, orbs etc. to study the capabilities of those objects. The article states the data is “confiscated” by “SV17q” under the “no-right-to-known dictum.” It states the DOLYN database has 17,500 signatures including non-terrestrial signatures.

<p><strong><em>Note</em></strong>: At the time this was published, Inman had left the NSA and CIA and was the CEO of Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation. Inman would join the Boards of SAIC, Wackenhut, Evolutionary Technologies International, Massey Energy and SBC over the next few years before being nominated by President Bill Clinton as Secretary of Defense (before nomination was withdrawn). Inman also managed Limestone Ventures, a start-up technology investment firm.</p>
<p>Wackenhut and SAIC are linked to allegations of secretive UAP work, most notably in CSETI’s briefing to Congress (see 30 August 1996).</p>

<p><strong>(PUBLIC DOMAIN)</strong> - <strong>20 October 2022</strong> — Ufologist Grant Cameron publishes a collection of people who claim to have piloted a UFO, many of whom never before spoke publicly. The trained observers mentioned include United Airlines Capt. Joe Vallejo who claims he had recurring dreams while on layovers where he was controlling a craft with his mind while standing in front of a large screen; ret.</p>
<p>USAF F-16 pilot “Col. David,” who claims he was in a room with a flat console along one wall where someone behind him told him he already knew how to fly the craft, and he began flying it mentally; and alleged Nellis AFB radar operator Niara Isley who claims she experienced a “neural interface” in a chair inside a saucer. In the book, ret. CIA analyst John Ramirez also states Tremelo Melchizedek was hired to attempt to use Merkabah meditation techniques to fly a craft in USG possession. Ramirez himself claims he travels mentally to an “icy planet” where he receives information from a “higher consciousness.”</p>
<p>The book additionally tracks Peter Whitley, an American who moved to Japan and trained in The Monroe Institute who held 40 out of body sessions where he was in a craft interacting with beings telepathically; ret. British Army officer Gerard Pratt who dreamt of going on board a large disc where he was given a briefing and shown how to use a plastic-like panel with symbols; Jean Kimura, who claims
while in Boynton Canyon near Sedona, AZ she and one friend had a shared dream in which they were invited by Saint Germain onto a craft with people that looked like humans; and Enrique Villanueva of Mission Rahma, who claims he used Merkabah meditation to go inside a “spaceship from a civilization supposedly from the future Earth.”</p>

<p><strong>(PUBLIC DOMAIN)</strong> - <strong>20 October 2022</strong> — Cameron also provides an audiotape of Green interviewing a woman “CRM” who was allegedly a psychic to understand UAP hotspots. CRM told Green about a “portal” related to a underwater UAP base near the Catalina Islands off the coast of Southern California, controlled by a group of extraterrestrials and humans, to which Green is surprised to hear.</p>
<p>A transcript of the conversation mentions there was a planned meeting between high ranking civilian and military personnel and “The Others,” “The Watchers,” and the “Extraterrestrials” to “give directions concerning geologic stabilization.” Human oil drilling catalyzed certain tectonic plate movements near the California coast. The council of those ET/UT species allegedly tasked with maintaining the stability of their Catalina “base.”</p>

<p><strong>(PUBLIC DOMAIN)</strong> - <strong>17 December 2022</strong> — A newly declassified calendar entry from former DCI Allen Dulles shows he met with President John F. Kennedy on 28 June 1961 at 12:00pm ET and 3:30pm ET. This may be significant because a disputed memo from JFK to Dulles on 28 June 1961 requests a review of “MJ-12” intelligence operation plans as they relate to Cold War psychological warfare plans.</p>
<p>A second disputed document allegedly created five months later on 5 November 1961 is an “operations review” of MJ-12 by Dulles, who references the JFK memo and also references that the operations are properly classified under the 1954 Atomic Energy Act.</p>
<p>A third disputed document also allegedly created that same date on 5 November 1961 is a Special National Intelligence Estimate on MJTWELVE operations prepared for the President’s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board. The document mentions it is classified under the Atomic Energy Act and mentions six crash recoveries of “unidentified space vehicles” in which nuclear materials were claimed to be involved. Hal Puthoff states the 1961 SNIE is legitimate.</p>
