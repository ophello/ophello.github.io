    <h2>About the Author</h2>
    
<p>I've been following this topic since 1998. I stumbled upon the Art Bell radio program (Coast-to-Coast AM) back in the late nineties, and quickly became obsessed with the show, tuning in nightly for a variety of supernatural, alien, and scientific topics. The open phone lines were endlessly entertaining. Many of the callers and guests were clearly quacks, but some of them seemed genuinely well-informed — and at times, 100% believable.</p>

<p>One of the guests was Dr Steven Greer, who was promoting his Disclosure Project and the upcoming 2001 National Press Club conference, which I proceeded to watch online. This was truly a watershed event for me. Here were dozens of ex-government officials speaking on the record about extraordinary craft in our skies, making maneuvers that were impossible for terrestrial craft to replicate. I immediately bought Greer's book "Extraterrestrial Contact: The Evidence and Implications" and pored over it. I spent weeks looking at UFO videos. I was hooked.</p>

<p><em>"This is real. Aliens are absolutely visiting our planet. And I am lucky enough to be in on it."</em></p>

<p>Having grown up on a diet of shows like "Star Trek: the Next Generation," I held an optimistic view of the universe. I naturally assumed that advanced beings must also have advanced morality. Thus, I immediately accepted Greer's core message that the aliens who are visiting us are either benevolent or indifferent. But malevolent? "No way! If they were malevolent, they would have killed us all by now!" His book was littered with arguments like this — and I accepted every one of them without question. He even insisted that the government is responsible for the disturbing aspects of the "abduction" phenomenon, which I had only begun to read about. "Governments are evil," I thought. "If they had access to ET technology, there's no telling what they might do to stay in power!" This felt like a no-brainer. It was all the proof I needed.</p>

<p>Around 2009, the Art Bell program also exposed me to Marshall Vian Summers, a somewhat enigmatic yet pleasant and thoughtful guest who would appear a few times on Coast-to-Coast AM. His tune was completely different. He claimed to have "received" a genuine communication from a group of benevolent off-planet ET observers who were attempting to warn humanity that this ET "intervention" was in fact purely exploitative. Summers wrote this all down in a series of briefings and published them starting in 2001. I found his claims to be highly dubious, since I considered "channeled" material to be untrustworthy. Curiosity got the best of me, and I decided I would suspend judgement and give it a good shakedown. I purchased a paperback copy on Amazon (note: the briefings are freely available online) and started to read it in earnest.</p>

<p>I was NOT prepared for this material. It was completely different from everything else I had read on this topic. None of the typical new-age mysticism was present. No Christian demonic interpretations. No esoteric or cryptic language. No riddles. No obfuscation. No "Ancient Aliens" mythology that absolutely permeated the topic and continues to dominate online discussions today.</p>

<p>The picture presented in this text was laid out with the careful precision of a college civics textbook, and its warning could not have been more grave:

<p>Earth is highly-prized by local alien trade groups who are competing with each other to acquire our planet and its biological resources. We are being systematically exploited and genetically interbred with so they can easily take control of our affairs and gain access to resources we are destroying, and whose value on interplanetary trade markets we cannot possibly fathom. The briefings made it clear that not only was it humanity's responsibility to defend the Earth and protest this "intervention," but that (depressingly) no one was coming to save us.</p>

<p>I was <em>gutted.</em> Surely the universe was not this cruel? Surely there are benevolent aliens who could rescue us from this fate? Surely some of the "positive experiences" from abductees refute this tale? Surely this is all made up? I couldn't accept these revelations. They were too depressing. They asked too much of me. After a few chapters into the book, I stopped reading. "Just another UFO cult," I thought.</p>

<p>I shelved the book and tried to return to my naive optimism: "Sure, some aliens might be bad, but there are also good ones here helping us out, right?" It wasn't hard to find lots of examples and accounts of benevolence online. I eagerly got swept up into the Corey Goode whistleblower revelations. I logged into the Gaia TV site and watched a live stream of David Wilcock's interviews and mystic appraisals. Friendly "blue avians" and "blue sphere beings" were working to usher our planet into an age of ascension. Earth was in good hands! Dr Greer was right all along!</p>

<p>But, as time went on, those stories began to feel more and more empty. They lacked the specificity and sobering clarity of the Allies material, which I kept picking up again and again. Eventually, something inside me clicked: "If these briefings are real," I thought, "there should be evidence of it." I needed to go deeper.</p>

<p>I started to willingly seek out information that demonstrated patterns of ET interbreeding and biological resource acquisition. I perused the work of Dr Karla Turner, David Jacobs, and Timothy Good. I went back to Linda Moulton Howe's website "Earthfiles", which I first discovered on the Art Bell program, but whose content I had previously ignored. I found detailed accounts of cattle and human mutilations, whose many victims had specific organs removed with surgical precision. I uncovered books, interviews, documents, and disturbing photos. I began to read abduction victims' harrowing accounts of fetal implantation and bodily violation so widespread and inexplicable that there was no way for human motivation or technology to explain it — so evil that there was no room left for benevolence.</p>

<p>The more I exposed myself to disturbing information, the more I began to question the "love-and-lighters'" motivations. Later I read about Dr Steven Greer's exclusive "CE-5" events, which people paid thousands of dollars to attend. Videos of these events appeared to be little more than flares on the horizon. The facade began to crumble. I started to see Greer, Wilcock, Goode, and other "starseed" figureheads not as humanity's spokespeople, but as mouthpieces for the very beings who were perpetrating these evils on an unsuspecting population.</p>

<p>Eventually, I could no longer accept the premise that any of the beings who are here today represent "benevolence" or "guardians" or "owners." Abductions were clearly not the sole activity of a corrupt government trying to "control the narrative." This was a systematic interbreeding program being carried out by non-human entitiies with advanced technology in order to subvert our species for their own gains. This was a campaign designed to blind us to their crimes, and manufacture our consent for their agenda. This was the "pacification program" that the Allies briefings warned us about.</p>

<p>So, what was I going to do about it?</p>

<p>I decided to join the online conversation, and to expose people to the evidence I had gathered. I spent a few years on Reddit in some of the UFO and supernatural forums. In 2022, after Elon Musk bought Twitter, I decided to revisit my old inactive account that I had made there in 2014. After some keyword searches, I discovered a thriving and active UFO community.</p>

<p>I repurposed my old account and have been there ever since — fighting for human sovereignty and sharing the material I have read in order to help steer the public discourse in what I truly believe to be the right direction. I have since dedicated 100% of my online activity to this goal — this website is just the beginning of that effort.</p>

<p>I will not stop until the ET crimes against humanity are exposed, and we collectively unite as a species and denounce this intervention with every last breath. Humanity has nothing to lose by openly and visibly protesting this "contact."</p>

<br>
<p><em>…And if I'm wrong?</em></p>

<p>Then the "benevolent aliens" can step in and set the record straight.</p>

<p>Funny how they don't.</p>
